Tim Green shares his journey as a songwriter and the success of their hit song 'Miracle in Me'. The conversation also touches on the reaction of other quartets and personnel to The Greens' unique sound.

They discuss how Kim Hopper's addition to the group elevated their success and how Tony would still be singing and promoting gospel music if he were alive today.

Founding members included the charismatic Glen Payne, alongside tenor Bobby Clark and baritone Danny Koker. Their transformation into the iconic quartet we revere today began with the addition of bass singer George Younce, marking the commencement of a new era in gospel music.</p> <p> </p> <p>Our hosts will guide you through The Cathedrals' pivotal decision to leave the safety of the Cathedral of Tomorrow in 1969 for the uncertain waters of full-time touring—a gamble that paid off immensely. We'll explore the transitions within the group as Koker and Clark departed, paving the way for Mack Taunton and George Amon Webster to join the ranks and further define The Cathedrals' sound and mission.</p> <p> </p> <p>With Daniel, Darien, and Arthur bringing their insider knowledge and heartfelt enthusiasm for Southern Gospel, expect intimate stories and insights into The Cathedrals' experiments with their musical and visual identity, under the progressive guidance of Canaan Records and producer Marvin Norcross.
