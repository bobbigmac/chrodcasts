    <title>Common Threads: An Interfaith Dialogue</title>
    <description>Rated as the #1 podcast on all matters interfaith by Feedspot (https://blog.feedspot.com/interfaith_podcasts/), this is a weekly program that airs on Michigan NPR affiliates WGVU and WGVK. These 2 stations cover the entire western portion of the state. The show is hosted by Fred Stella, President of Interfaith Dialogue Association, an affiliate of Kaufman Interfaith Institute, which operates out of Grand Valley State University, the license holder of  both stations.

Each week Fred invites clerics, authors, activists and the occasional mystic into conversation about the role of spirituality and religion in politics, world affairs, societies and individuals. The parameters are quite wide.

Besides his passion for all things transcendent, Fred Stella has an extensive resume in the world of media. Since his graduation from college Fred has worked in multiple radio formats, including news/talk, where he developed his skills in the art of the interview. He also has extensive experience in TV, stage, web entertainment, audiobook narration and more. He lives in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</description>

      <title>The Plight of the Bhutanese Refugees Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[There are so many vulnerable populations around the world, and it's hard to keep up with them all. One group that sustained very serious abuse is the Hindu community in the Asian nation of Bhutan. Oddly, for centuries there existed a comity between Hindus and Buddhists that was inspiring to see. In Nepal, many people practice both. So it's quite disheartening to learn that over 20 years ago, the despotic Buddhist king of Bhutan expelled over 100,000 Hindu citizens of Nepali heritage. For 2 decades these hardworking people lived in cramped huts in refugee camps in Nepal before being dispersed to welcoming countries.
In these episodes we talk with Narad Adhikari from the Global  Bhutanese Hindu Organization about this travesty that he, his family and many dear friends survived and ultimately thrived. This one is a heartbreaker, kids. But very inspirational. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Contemplate: Toward an Expansive Heart Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[
In recent weeks we've been uploading some episodes from about 15 years ago that were recently discovered. This, however, is not one of those. It aired in early 2026. Stay tuned though. More oldies are on their way!

When comparing the world's religions on the subject of contemplation/meditation, Christianity can point to a tradition of monasteries where monks and nuns have engaged in such practices for centuries. Yet, very little has filtered down to those in the pews. One reason so many Christians turned to the wisdom of the East is the the deep-seated desire to learn the art of sitting in silence. In our conversation with Jacob here we see that there is an attempt to encourage Christians (in this case, Catholics) to embrace this path of sacred stillness.  Theme music "Nigal."

One more from the newly found archive! So let's set the Wayback Machine for 2009 again. This time we spoke to Dr. Paul Knitter, the author of "If It Were Not for Buddha I Would Not Be a Christian." I recall really enjoying this conversation.

This book  narrates how esteemed theologian, Paul F. Knitter, overcame a crisis of faith by looking to Buddhism for inspiration. From prayer to how Christianity views life after death, Knitter argues that a Buddhist standpoint can encourage a more person-centered conception of Christianity where individual religious experience comes 1st, and liturgy and tradition 2nd.

      <title>Religion &amp; Modernity:The 2009 Kaufman Conference Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[OK Kids, here's another classic Common Threads that was misplaced ages ago and is now available. The Kaufman Interfaith Institute (of which Interfaith Dialogue Association is an affiliate) holds conferences each year.  In 2009 we hosted 3 thought leaders from the Abrahamic traditions to discuss the challenge of modernity and religion. We decided to interview James Carroll, a noted Catholic influencer (in '09 we did not even know that was a word, but that's what he was). As with most, if not all, of these archived episodes, the relevance of the conversation holds up against time. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>No Enemy Left to Conquer: Forgiveness in an Unforgiving World Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Dipping into our newly discovered tranche of old episodes once more, we have another 2009 pair that explores a very power book about the power of forgiveness. 
Michael Henderson is a British freelance journalist and author of numerous books including Forgiveness: Breaking the Chain of Hate and All Her Paths Are Peace. He is convinced that forgiveness is like a muscle that must be exercised. He has gathered inspiring and edifying stories of individuals and organizations around the world who have sought to advance reconciliation among enemies and to bring about peace rather than sustain enmity. In the foreword, His Holiness the Dalai Lama writes:
"When something terrible happens, instead of finding some individual or group to blame, fostering hatred and a desire for revenge, we should try to take a broader view and consider the long term. Much more constructive than stoking feelings of resentment and revenge is to forgive and transform the negative event and its consequences into a source of inner strength."  Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>In Living Color: Calvinism Explained Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Another one from the newly discovered batch of old recordings. I'm assuming this is from 2009 as most of them are. This 2-parter is a conversation with Daniel Hyde, a pastor in the United Reformed Church. We invited him to discuss his book on Christian images "In Living Color," but also delved into the Calvinist movement within Protestantism. You see, Common Threads is produced in Grand Rapids, Michigan. And this part of the state is an epicenter of Calvinism (also known as Reformed Theology). I think these episodes are the most in-depth dive we've taken on this show.  Sorry it's taken so long to get online. Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[Once again we delve into the vault of recently discovered recordings that never made it to the podcast universe. These come from 2009. So please disregard any information about the conference on Islam that is being promoted. 
I've thought about these conversations over the years. I'll tell you why. As you might know, while I may ask probing questions, and on occasion uncomfortable ones, I'm not out to go all 60 Minutes on a guest, right?  But every once in a while someone does say something that I just can't ignore. Well, in this case I did. At some point (either in Part 1 or 2, I can't recall) I ask our guests if there was any country on earth that they would put up as an example of a model Muslim nation. There wasn't much discussion. Immediately one of them said it would be Saudi Arabia. Wait...what...? Saudi Arabia? You mean that repressive state that controls personal behavior in almost every aspect? Where women were not allowed to drive until 2018? Seriously? 
I can't believe I let that go unchallenged. But I did. My bad. But other than that it was a reasonably good discussion. You will notice that the terrorist attack of 9/11/01 took up a fair amount of time. Obviously, only 8 years from that date the incident was still quite present in our minds as we continued to deal with the trauma. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Halakhah of Jesus According to the Gospel of Matthew Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Here we go again! As mentioned recently, I discovered a trove of old recordings on CD and cassette tape that I was not aware of. So now I'm posting these here. These episodes of Common Threads originally aired in 2007. They have to do with the very "Jewishness" of Jesus. The book in question is "The Halakhah of Jesus of Nazareth According to the Gospel According to St. Matthew." Scholars agree that it is the most Jewish of all the Gospels. It was written by Rabbi Phillip Sigal, who held the distinction of being a rabbi with an advanced degree in New Testament studies. Since he died prior to the release of this 2007 version of the book we discuss its contents with 3 people who know this material well: Lillian Sigal (Phillip's widow and scholar in her own right), Rabbi Simcha Prombaum and interfaith academic Leonard Swidler.  Yes, a cassette from almost 20 years ago might not sound as crisp as we'd like, but we think it's still quite a good listen. 
By the way, Lillian Sigal is a co-founder of Interfaith Dialogue Association and still a dear friend.  Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Crimes Against India Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Hey All, we've got ourselves a blast from the past! For those of you who have been following us for a few years you might recall that not long after we started podcasting we decided to go into The Vault and grab as many old analog recordings that survived over the decades, digitize them and add to our podcast library. So if you're not aware already, keep scrolling down and you'll see episodes from as far back as the late 90s. I really thought we were done with all that, but in cleaning out a desk drawer I found a few more. This one dates back to 2009. Here we interview Stephen Knapp, a brilliant writer on Vedic culture. We discuss his new (at the time) book called "The War Against India." Here's how he explains it:

India has one of the oldest and most dynamic cultures in the world. Yet, many people do not know of the countless attacks, wars, atrocities, and sacrifices that Indian people have undergone to protect and preserve their country and spiritual tradition over the centuries. Neither do many people know of the numerous ways in which this profound heritage is being attacked and threatened today, and what we can do about it. Therefore, we should carefully understand:
 How there is presently a war against Hinduism and its yoga culture.
    The weaknesses of India that allowed invaders to conquer her.
    Lessons from India's real history that should not be forgotten.
    The atrocities committed by the Muslim invaders, and how they tried to destroy Vedic culture and its many temples, and slaughtered thousands of Indian Hindus.
    How the British viciously exploited India and its people for its resources.
    How the cruelest of all Christian Inquisitions in Goa tortured and killed thousands of Hindus.
    Action plans for preserving and strengthening Vedic India today.
    How all Hindus and concerned people must stand up and be strong for protecting the universal spiritual traditions of Vedic culture.

      <title>The Fox Hunt: Trapped in Yemen Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[

Born in the Old City of Sana’a, Yemen, to a pair of middle-class doctors, Mohammed Al Samawi was a devout Muslim raised to think of Christians and Jews as his enemy. But then he started connecting with Jews and Christians on social media, and at various international interfaith conferences, Mohammed became an activist, making it his mission to promote dialogue and cooperation in Yemen. Due to his work, Mohammed found himself fighting for his life amidst the sectarian strife in Yemen. The story of his escape, which is recorded in his new book The Fox Hunt, is at once thrilling and disturbing. Fred Stella speaks with Mohammed Al Samawi, discussing the backstory of this compelling account as well as Mohmmed's interfaith work here in the U.S. that was inspired by the TV show Friends.

      <title>Hebrew Orientalism Parts 1, 2 &amp; 3</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This is a  conversation between Dr. Hussein and GVSU Professor Eric Covey, facilitated by Frankel Center's Interim Director for 2025-26, Deborah Dash Moore. Their discussion will be followed by a dessert reception.  Drawing from his upcoming book, Hebrew Orientalism: Jewish Engagement with Arabo-Islamic Culture in Late Ottoman and British Palestine, Dr. Hussein will explore how Jewish writers in late Ottoman and British Mandate Palestine utilized Arabo-Islamic culture. In the decades before the establishment of a Jewish state in 1948, native and immigrant Jews in Palestine mediated between Jewish and Arab cultures while navigating their evolving identities as settler colonists. Hebrew Orientalism challenges the conventional view that Hebrew thinkers were dismissive of Arabo-Islamic culture, revealing how they both adopted and adapted elements of it that enhanced their aims.

      <title>Karmic Relief Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[

Just about everyone knows the word "karma." It's so popular that products and companies are using it. But to simply say "what goes around comes around" is a bit too simplistic to describe a doctrine that has influenced civilizations for millennia.

In his new book ‘Karmic Relief’ author Phil Goldberg provides the deep detail underlying this concept in a way that is understandable by both theologians and those without advanced Religious Studies degrees alike. This week Fred Stella engages with Phil on the basic beliefs of both karma and rebirth.

      <title>The Comparative Gospels Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[

The Gospel COMPARATIVE is an innovative new book that enables anyone to read all 4 gospels simultaneously as one story. This is done in a clear, easy-to-read design that presents all four of the canonical gospels at the same time. Additionally, it provides a side-by-side, line-by-line comparative that seamlessly integrates with the storytelling process. 

Several things combine to make the design of this book quite unique. For example each 2- page spread is viewed and read as a whole. This is visually explained on the Introduction Page. And just like a movie script, the story is crafted into scenes. This way it provides the fullest possible content, while creating the complete picture for each and every scene. This alone, makes it more accessible to everybody.

Next is the stripped-down approach, which uses only the original text. From there the story is simply laid out in a way that follows the timeline progressively. This layout allows all four versions to live side-by-side; duplicating in each account where they will and standing alone where they will.

This years-long effort by editor Michael Degnan was inspired by his professional experience of helping corporations and people tell their stories. In Michael's eyes, the Gospels are nothing if not the weaving together of a great story. On this episode of Common Threads, Fred and Michael discuss the benefits of reading Scripture in this manner.

      <title>Mother Emanuel Church Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[
10 years ago the nation experienced a powerful tragedy when a radicalized racist opened fire in the sanctuary of Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Located in Charleston, South Carolina, Mother Emanuel is often considered the jewel in the crown of historical Black churches. In his book Mother Emanuel: 2 Centuries of Race, Resistance and Forgiveness in one Charleston Church, Kevin Sack explores in great detail the history of not only Mother Emanuel, but of the development of Black Christianity in the early years of our country. 
In these episodes Fred Stella speaks with Kevin Sack to discuss his motivation behind writing this book, and how things have both changed and remained the same for the Black Church in the South.

      <title>Ancient Christianities Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[

The ancient Mediterranean teemed with gods. For centuries, a practical religious pluralism prevailed. How, then, did one Deity come to dominate the politics and piety of the late Roman Empire?

In ‘Ancient Christianities,’ Paula Fredriksen traces the evolution of early Christianity, or rather, of early Christianities through five centuries of Empire, mapping its pathways from the hills of Judea to the halls of Rome and Constantinople. It is a story with a sprawling cast of characters: not only theologians, bishops, and emperors, but also gods and demons, angels and magicians, astrologers and ascetics, saints and heretics, aristocratic patrons and millenarian enthusiasts. All played their part in the development of what became and remains an energetically diverse biblical religion.

Paula Fredriksen continues with host Fred Stella on the various religious, political, and social reasons that what most call Christianity in the 21st century is the worldview that won out in the marketplace of ideas 2,000 years ago.

Paula Fredriksen has been distinguished visiting professor in the Department of Comparative Religion at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, since 2009 (now emerita).

Fredriksen served as an historical consultant and featured speaker in many media, including for the BBC production The Lives of Jesus (1996) and for U.S. News & World Report's "The Life and Times of Jesus". Fredriksen's book From Jesus to Christ: The Origins of the Early Images of Jesus served as a template for the Frontline documentary From Jesus to Christ: The First Christians.

      <description><![CDATA[

As Christianity began as a sect of Judaism, Jainism was once considered a branch of Hinduism. These religions continue to share a great deal of theology, history and ritual. Yet, Jains do most often claim an identity separate from Hindus.

In this episode Fred speaks with Monica Shah, Director of Education for the Jain Society of Metropolitan Washington. They discuss the intricacies of this ancient faith whose pious adherents practice "radical" forms of nonviolence.

      <title>Defending Democracy from Its Christian Enemies Parts 1, 2 &amp; 3</title>
      <description><![CDATA[American democracy is in danger. How do we protect it from authoritarian reactionary Christianity?  

On January 6, 2021, hundreds of Americans stormed the Capitol to prevent the certification of their political opponent’s election. At the forefront were Christians claiming to act in the name of Jesus Christ and his supposed representative on earth, Donald Trump. How can this have happened?  

David P. Gushee tackles the question in this timely work of Christian political ethics. Gushee calls us to preserve democratic norms, including constitutional government, the rule of law, and equal rights for all, even as many Christians take a reactionary and antidemocratic stance. Surveying global politics and modern history, he analyzes how Christians have discarded their commitment to democracy and bought into authoritarianism. He urges us to fight back by reviving our hard-won traditions of congregational democracy, dissident Black Christian politics, and covenantal theology.  

Defending Democracy from Its Christian Enemies makes a robust case for a renewed commitment to democracy on the part of Christians—not by succumbing to secular liberalism, but by drawing on our own best traditions.  Any concerned Christian will leave its pages with eyes wide open to the dangers of our current form of political engagement. Readers will gain insight into what democracy is truly meant to be and why Christians once supported it wholeheartedly—and should do so again.

This conversation and book talk with David P. Gushee and Kristin Kobes Du Mez took place on March 15, 2024 and was sponsored by Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, Schuler Books, and the Kaufman Interfaith Institute.  Theme music "Nigal."

Gushee calls us to preserve democratic norms, including constitutional government, the rule of law, and equal rights for all, even as many Christians take a reactionary and antidemocratic stance. Surveying global politics and modern history, he analyzes how Christians have discarded their commitment to democracy and bought into authoritarianism. He urges us to fight back by reviving our hard-won traditions of congregational democracy, dissident Black Christian politics, and covenantal theology.  

Defending Democracy from Its Christian Enemies makes a robust case for a renewed commitment to democracy on the part of Christians—not by succumbing to secular liberalism, but by drawing on our own best traditions.  Any concerned Christian will leave its pages with eyes wide open to the dangers of our current form of political engagement. Readers will gain insight into what democracy is truly meant to be and why Christians once supported it wholeheartedly—and should do so again.

This conversation and book talk with David P. Gushee and Kristin Kobes Du Mez took place on March 15, 2024 and was sponsored by Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, Schuler Books, and the Kaufman Interfaith Institute. </itunes:summary>

      <title>Yogalands Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[

Millions of people practice yoga, attracted to the mat by its promise of physical and mental benefits, social connection, and spiritual nourishment. Promoted as a way of healing the body and mind from wounds inflicted by the world, modern yoga may be a critique of the social order – an “anti-world” to which practitioners escape.

Yet yoga can never free itself entirely from the compromises and contradictions of reality. In these episodes  we speak with the author of ‘Yogalands: In Search of Practice on the Mat and in the World,’ wherein Paul Bramadat wrestles with his position as a skeptical scholar who is also a devoted yoga practitioner.

Drawing from his own experience, and from conversations with hundreds of yoga teachers and students in the United States and Canada, he seeks to understand what yoga means for people in the modern West. In doing so, he addresses issues that often sit beneath the surface in yogaland: why yoga’s religious dimensions are rarely mentioned in classes; how the relationship between yoga and trauma might be reconsidered; and how yoga seems to have survived debates around nationalism, cultural appropriation, and sexual misconduct.

Yogalands encourages practitioners and critics to be more curious about yoga. For insiders, this can deepen their practice, and for observers, this approach is an inspiring and unsettling model for engaging with other passionate commitments.

      <title>Creating Jesus: The Earliest Record of Yeshua of Nazareth Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Creating Jesus is a book for general readers on the Gospel of Mark as the earliest surviving witness of the life of Yeshua ("Jesus" in Aramaic) of Nazareth. Dennis Kennedy applies his expertise in literary and performance studies to examining Mark as a literary and historical document and describes in straightforward style how it differs from the other Gospels, what it meant in its time, and how it has been used in history. He investigates the oral Jesus tradition before Mark, the radical act of writing about a crucified preacher from the hinterland, the expansion of the Messiah cult in the Roman Empire, and the character of the faith that the earliest Gospel proposes. Interspersed with incidents from Kennedy’s own education, Creating Jesus seeks to reveal why Mark was written, the great influence it has had, and how it might question the nature of Christianity in the present.

      <title>Life With Ghosts Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Science is studying ghosts? Really?

In Life with Ghosts, a documentary film festival winner, a widow suffering prolonged grief agrees to participate in a research study that aims to reconnect bereaved survivors with their departed loved ones. The process is known as Induced After-Death Communication (IADC), and it is rapidly gaining recognition among psychologists, academics and bereavement professionals.

Life with Ghosts records the first-ever publicly funded attempt to facilitate contact with deceased individuals to determine if such contact can be used to reduce severe grief symptoms. In an area where traditional talk therapy has been largely ineffective, at a time when 70,000 Americans die from prescription drug misuse in a single year, this film heralds a welcome alternative for the chronically bereaved.

In this edition of Common Threads, Host Fred Stella interviews Stephen Berkeley, the director of the film. Whether you believe in ghosts or not, this conversation will give one pause to consider. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Terran Judaism: A 21st Century Version of Ancient Wisdom  Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[


Alex Duensing, founder of Terran Judaism, joins us

Most non-Jews who have any familiarity with Judaism will tell you there are 3 specific movements within the religion: Orthodox, Conservative & Reform. But there are several more. And now a new one has entered the arena: Terran Judaism.

The word "Terran" indicates that is it is "from the earth." That is, they seek to expand the faith well beyond the borders of Israel and any perceived dominant ethnicity. Today we will converse with the founder of this new sect.

Alex Duensing lives in suburban Detroit. He currently is focusing on maintaining an online community, but is hopeful it will grow from there.

      <description><![CDATA[

If they only taught this in Religion classes! I promise students would be way more engaged. In these episodes we dive into the fascinating and overlooked aspects of the Catholic faith with Michael Lichens, the author of The Weird Catholic Handbook. We’ll examine peculiar and intriguing elements of Catholic history, offering a refreshing perspective on the faith that combines humor, curiosity, and profound insights. These include many bizarre and extraordinary stories that have shaped Catholicism. From saints who faced mythical monsters to the eerie beauty of bone chapels, this book uncovers the spiritual and historical significance behind these oddities. With a blend of scholarly research and engaging storytelling, Lichens brings to life the unique relics, ghostly encounters, and unusual miracles that have been part of the Church’s rich tapestry.

      <description><![CDATA[No matter how some people try to deny it, we humans are very tribal. And for the most part, that can be a good thing if we will forego any sense of tribal superiority. So if one is excommunicated from a tribe the mental and spiritual toll can be significant.

In her book ‘Ghosted’ Nancy French describes her upbringing in a Fundamentalist Christian church and early alliance with conservative Republican politics. For years she made her living as a ghost writer for several prominent right-wing politicians. But when she and her husband declared themselves to be Never Trumpers, doors closed, calls were ignored and friends abandoned them. In this episode we speak with Nancy about the trauma, betrayal and heartbreak of maintaining high principles in the face of such challenges. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Who Are the Alawites? Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[With the exile of Syria's Bashar Al-Assad recently, much interest has been focused on the sect of Islam of which he was a member. However, there are some who claim that the denomination known as Alawite is not Islam at all, but a heretical break-off sect. To understand this somewhat intricate situation we speak with Dr. Stefan Winter who has studied religion in Syria and Turkey for decades.

Stefan Winter is a Canadian historian specializing in the study of Ottoman Syria. He teaches at the Université du Québec à Montréal and has been visiting professor at Koç University in Istanbul. His research concentrates on Shi‘i, Bedouin and Kurdish principalities in northern Syria and southern Anatolia and has been published by Cambridge University Press, Princeton University Press and in a number of academic journals. His work won the Syrian Studies Association's prize for best dissertation in 2002 and the Ottoman and Turkish Studies Association's Fuat Köprülü Award in 2017. Theme music "Nigal."

      <itunes:summary>With the exile of Syria&apos;s Bashar Al-Assad recently, much interest has been focused on the sect of Islam of which he was a member. However, there are some who claim that the denomination known as Alawite is not Islam at all, but a heretical break-off sect. To understand this somewhat intricate situation we speak with Dr. Stefan Winter who has studied religion in Syria and Turkey for decades.

Stefan Winter is a Canadian historian specializing in the study of Ottoman Syria. He teaches at the Université du Québec à Montréal and has been visiting professor at Koç University in Istanbul. His research concentrates on Shi‘i, Bedouin and Kurdish principalities in northern Syria and southern Anatolia and has been published by Cambridge University Press, Princeton University Press and in a number of academic journals. His work won the Syrian Studies Association&apos;s prize for best dissertation in 2002 and the Ottoman and Turkish Studies Association&apos;s Fuat Köprülü Award in 2017.</itunes:summary>

      <title>Job in Wonderland Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[
Our guest is Ryan Armstrong, author of The Book of Job in Wonderland

Of all of the great works of literature that might be compared, the idea of setting the text of the Book of Job next to the 19th century classic Alice in Wonderland probably doesn't come to mind. But Religious Studies professor Ryan Armstrong did notice more than a few links between them and presents them in his book The Book of Job in Wonderland: Making (Non)Sense of Job's Mediators.Yes, serious theological study and whimsy can certainly be paired on occasion, and this is one of those. What do Job and Alice have in common? What characters in Wonderland might resonate with God, Satan and the friends of Job? And what can we take from this connection, if indeed there is one? Join us for this fascinating (and yes, whimsical) conversation.

Ryan M. Armstrong is Visiting Assistant Professor of Hebrew Bible at Oklahoma State University. His research focuses on ancient Hebrew literature within its linguistic and historical context and its impact on interpreters throughout history.

      <title>The Midrash Tradition Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[One of the most imaginative traditions in Judaism is called "Midrash." While the word is used in a few different ways, in this episode we are referring to that practice of taking biblical stories and "filling in the blanks" with imagined conversations, prequels and sequels. For instance, what might Adam and Eve discussed after leaving Eden? How might Sarah have reacted upon learning that Isaac was close to being sacrificed?

Rabbis and some brilliant thought leaders down through the centuries have used this device to both educate and entertain. Our guest is Rabbi Jefferey Salkin, who will explore not only the Midrash of sacred scripture, but the use of it in secular literature and film. A perfect example is the play/movie "Wicked," which fills in the blanks of "Wizard of Oz." Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Pierre Teilhard de Chardin Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[

In this episode we discuss a new film biography of Fr. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin with its producer/director Frank Frost.

This remarkable man was a paleontologist and visionary French Jesuit priest. His lifelong effort to reframe his beliefs in the light of evolution led to a paradigm shift in the relationship of science and religion. Teilhard foresaw the emergence of the internet, globalization, technological innovation, and the embrace of human responsibility for continuing evolution.

His legacy includes hope-filled spirituality and a robust environmental movement. He is now the subject of a two-hour biography on public television that captures his triumphs and trials, his love for the divine and the human, and his trust in the future.

      <title>Hindu Catholic Scholar Priest: A Love Story Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Today we discuss the autobiography that traces Francis X. Clooney's intellectual and spiritual journey from middle-class American Catholicism to a lifelong study of Hinduism. It explains how he came to fashion comparative theology as a way of learning interreligiously that is boldly intellectual and deeply personal and practical, lived out in intersections of his roles as theologian and scholar of Hinduism, as professor and Catholic priest, and over the tumultuous decades from the 1960s until now, in his role as a Professor of Divinity, Harvard University.

Clooney sheds fresh and realistic light on the idea and ideal of scholar-practitioner, since his wide learning, Christian and Hindu, is grounded in his Catholic and Jesuit commitments, as well as in a commensurate learning with respect to several Hindu traditions that are most accessible to scholars willing to learn empathetically and in a participatory manner.

What Clooney has learned and written must be understood in terms of a love of Christ deeply informed by a Hindu instinct for loving God without reserve. A fundamental spiritual disposition - intuitions of God present everywhere - has energized his work over his long career, love giving direction and body to his professional academic work.

      <title>Honest to God Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[

In his new book Honest to God, Rev. John Hamilton provides us with an intimate look at the spiritual journey of an individual who has experienced life from many corners. From the carefree life of a rock n' roll musician, to a "Madmen" style of life on Madison Avenue to being ordained in the United Church of Christ.

In this episode he discusses not only his sacred search, but also the state of Christianity and institutional religion in general. It's a prophecy of both hope and a bit of trepidation, as religious leaders face a demand for significant change by many who have left the pews.

Bio from publisher’s website:

John Hamilton was born into a spirited Irish-American family of singers and storytellers. Breaking with his strict Catholic upbringing, he embarked on a career in music that immersed him in the colorful but dangerous world of drugs, alcohol, and rock clubs.

A debilitating onset of panic disorder abruptly halted his musical pursuits, propelling him into the business world where he thrived as a creative director in advertising.

Despite professional success, Hamilton’s persistent quest for the transcendent led him to seminary and, eventually, to two decades of parish work as a pastor. In “Honest To God,” he eloquently chronicles the collapse of the mainstream Christianity, his loss of connection to the transcendent and his walk into the wilderness to search for it again.

      <title>Trad Catholics and Christian Nationalism</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Dr. Lauren Horn Griffin discusses White Christian Nationalism and so-called "Trad Catholic Men"

With the current election in the rear-view mirror now, the pundits are now piecing together what worked for one candidate and didn't for the other. One element that played large in the campaign is the role of White Christian Nationalism.

Here we interview Dr. Lauren Horn Griffin from Louisiana State University, who has been studying movements such as these for most of her academic career.

Our conversation today focuses on both the role of so-called "Trad Catholic Men" play in our social/political landscape as well as how competing narratives can shape a nation. Dr. Griffin is the author of ‘Fabricating Founders in Early Modern England.’

Lauren earned her Ph.D. in Religious Studies from the University of California, Santa Barbara (2016). At LSU, she researches and teaches about religion, technology, media, and politics.

      <title>Boond: The Story of the Ultimate Journey Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I liken this new book entitled "Boond" to the classic "Little Prince." That is, while it may have a certain childlike charm, it is not really a children's book. This is a tale of the Divine Quest. Boond is Sanskrit for "drop," as in a drop of water. And that is exactly what the star of our story is: an anthropomorphic drop of water. We rarely feature books of fiction on Common Threads, but we made an exception here due to the intelligence, wit and whimsy contained in this tale. It really could be called a modern day myth. 

Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Italian Folk Magic Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Growing up in an Italian-American family, I was introduced to Malocchio (the Evil Eye) at a young age. I loved having this eccentric idea as part of my heritage. For centuries, some cultures have been able to accommodate both their Christian traditions along with various elements of folk magic, esoteric healing and what has come to be known as "witchcraft." Italy is no exception. Angela Puca is about the most perfect person to discuss these issues with. She was raised in Naples and has advanced degrees in Religious Studies. In her research she was able  to gain the confidence of many folk magic practitioners who are no longer living in seclusion in tiny rural Italian villages. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Rise &amp; Fall of the 2nd American Republic Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A groundbreaking, expansive new account of Reconstruction that fundamentally alters our view of this formative period in American history. We are told that the present moment bears a strong resemblance to Reconstruction, when freedpeople and the federal government attempted to create an interracial democracy in the south after the Civil War. That effort was overthrown and serves as a warning today about violent backlash to the mere idea of black equality and the weaponization of religion. In The Rise and Fall of the Second American Republic , acclaimed historian Manisha Sinha expands our view beyond the usual temporal and spatial bounds of Reconstruction (1865–1877) to explain how the Civil War, the overthrow of Reconstruction, the conquest of the west, labor conflict in the north, Chinese exclusion, women’s suffrage, and the establishment of an overseas American empire were part of the same struggle between the forces of democracy and those of reaction. Highlighting the critical role of black people in redefining American citizenship and governance, Sinha’s book shows that Reconstruction laid the foundation of our democracy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Devout: A Memoir of Doubt Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[It is hard to imagine anyone living in the USA today who does not either have someone close to them dealing with severe mental health challenges or suffering themselves from the same. An educated guess is that not only are we experiencing a rise in such maladies, but thankfully, the stigma of admitting to having them is much less than in the past. This encourages an openness we not seen in the past. 

And one thing that comes to us from mental health professionals loud and clear is that religion/spirituality can either help or hurt, depending on how it is expressed in one's development. On these episodes we speak to Anna Gazmarian, the author of Devout:A Memoir of Doubt.  She grew up in an Evangelical community that encouraged "happy thoughts" and prayer to chase away the clouds of gloom. This approach is as beneficial as "pray the gay away" is to those in the LGBT community. 
It's not hard to hear the pain in Anna's voice in our conversation. Life has been rough, and the scars are still there. What you will hear is deeply personal and somewhat frustrating when we think of all the others like Anna who may be in similar situations and keep thinking that they just aren't good enough or don't love Jesus enough to be made whole. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Constitutional Bind Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Not long ago Convicted Felon D. Trump began shamelessly hawking "Greenwood" Bibles that include not only all 66 Protestant canonical books but The Constitution and Bill of Rights as well. A serious problem we have in the USA is that a number of American citizens believe that our founding documents are quasi-scriptural. In their minds, the Founding Fathers were tapping into The Mind of God when composing such.  

Now, it's hard to deny that these writings offer some literally world changing ideas that have allowed us as a country to evolve in ways that other nations were not able to do.  But they are far from infallible. And of course, any documents are only as good as the people who interpret them. In these episodes our guest Aziz Rana shares his concerns as to how The Constitution has failed us in many ways, and how this Supreme Court is poised to do serious damage to the American people.

Not for the faint of heart, but a great conversation. Listen. Learn. Repeat. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Mountain at a Center of the World Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Places of pilgrimage tend to be held as sacred spaces by particular religions. But it's not universally true. Sometimes there are holy sites that are venerated by 2 or more faiths. Adam's Peak in Sri Lanka is one of them. It is climbed constantly by Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and secularists. I suspect it would be climbed by Jews if there were any in the country.  Each religion has its own myth and history surrounding the mountain. And surprise, surprise...Adam's Peak is not without religious conflict and controversy. But that's what makes for a good story, yes? Thankfully, Alexander McKinley has written one. In these episodes we discuss the blessings and challenges of the multi-faith engagement  that is a part of this tradition. His book is Mountain at a Center of the World.  Listen. Then read.

      <title>Nature My Teacher Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ Ever run into one of those people whose resumes are so bloody full of awesome accomplishments that you wonder why they even let you take up precious space on earth? Well this is one of those guys. James Thornton is a world-renowned environmental lawyer, author, poet, and Zen Buddhist priest. The New Statesman named him as one of 10 people who could change the world, and he has won the Financial Times Lifetime Achievement Award for Innovation in Law. James is the founder and president of Client Earth, the leading global not-for-profit law group who represent the natural world, advocate for policy changes that protect it, and hold governments and corporations accountable where policies have been violated. James is also the author of Client Earth which won the Judge’s Choice Business Book of the Year Award. In 2021, he was a judge of the Laurel Prize for the world’s best collection of eco-poetry, pointing to his deep understanding of the genre.

Nature, My Teacher is his latest work. It is divided into 12 books, each a sequence of intimate essays, James investigates the nature of human consciousness. James discusses his own anxiety, why anxiety is a rational response to climate change, and he explains why environmental problems are mental problems. Both from his work as an environmental lawyer and his role as a Zen Buddhist priest, James shows us ways to find hope in a world under threat. This book is a meditation on those principles that will serve to both ease our fears and invigorate us to take action.
Of course, I kid about those of us lesser mortals "taking up space" here. We all are worth something. Still. People like James do make one take stock. Theme music "Nigal."

Nature, My Teacher is his latest work. It is divided into 12 books, each a sequence of intimate essays, James investigates the nature of human consciousness. James discusses his own anxiety, why anxiety is a rational response to climate change, and he explains why environmental problems are mental problems. Both from his work as an environmental lawyer and his role as a Zen Buddhist priest, James shows us ways to find hope in a world under threat. This book is a meditation on those principles that will serve to both ease our fears and invigorate us to take action.
Of course, I kid about those of us lesser mortals &quot;taking up space&quot; here. We all are worth something. Still. People like James do make one take stock.</itunes:summary>

      <title>Raging Fire of Love parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For centuries theologians, clergy and laity within the Abrahamic traditions have made great attempts to define where the concepts of love and justice fall within their faiths.

Many Christians are quick to acknowledge that Christianity is indeed a religion founded on the principle of love, but look upon the Hebrew scriptures as being little more than a set of moral codes provided by a deity who is more concerned with the performance of ritual and appeasement. A similar view is held by many about Islam.

But in Kelly Clark's new book 'Raging Fire of Love' he takes a deep dive into the sacred scriptures of these religions to offer evidence that all of them hold as their high priority the understanding that the God of Judaism, Christianity and Islam is a loving God; and that adherents to those religions are expected to replicate that love to our "neighbors" (read: everyone) in daily life.

      <title>Missionary Diplomacy: Sending Jesus &amp; The American Way Around the World Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[

Fred Stella welcomes MSU historian Emily Conroy-Krutz to Common Threads to discuss her book, Missionary Diplomacy

The American Christian church has historically been at the forefront of the missionary movement abroad. This is not news. But what many people are not aware of is that for much of the 19th century, Church and State engaged in a serious effort to marry the work of missionaries with a burgeoning diplomatic corps. So, along with evangelizing the peoples of many nations, these churchmen and women were influencing foreign policy and international relations.

As with most human endeavors, there are bright spots and dark ones. In her new book, Missionary Diplomacy, Prof. Conroy Krutz illuminates the crucial place of religion in nineteenth-century American diplomacy. From the 1810s through the 1920s, Protestant missionaries positioned themselves as key experts in the development of American relations in Asia, Africa, the Pacific, and the Middle East.

Missionaries served as consuls, translators, and occasional trouble-makers who forced the State Department to take actions it otherwise would have avoided. Yet as decades passed, more Americans began to question the propriety of missionaries’ power. Were missionaries serving the interests of American diplomacy? Or were they creating unnecessary problems?

As Emily Conroy-Krutz demonstrates, they were doing both. Across the century, missionaries forced the government to articulate new conceptions of the rights of U.S. citizens abroad and of the role of the US as an engine of humanitarianism and religious freedom. By the time the US entered the first world war, missionary diplomacy had for nearly a century created the conditions for some Americans to embrace a vision of their country as an internationally engaged world power. Emiy’s book, Missionary Diplomacyexposes the longstanding influence of evangelical missions on the shape of American foreign relations.

Emily Conroy-Krutz is a historian of the global history of nineteenth-century America. She has particular interests in American empire and the international dimensions of American religion and reform. She is also the author of Christian Imperialism: Converting the World in the Early American Republic (Cornell, 2015). Along with Michael Blaakman and Noelani Arista, she edited The Early Imperial Republic: From the American Revolution to the U.S.-Mexcian War (Penn, 2023).

At Michigan State, she teaches courses on American foreign relations, women’s history, revolutionary America, religion, and legal history. She serves as undergraduate honors advisor and mentors the History Scholars. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Uncharted Territory: The Catholic Church Declaration on Blessing Gay Couples Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Over the years we've had many discussions on human sexuality and spirituality, including religion's response to homosexuality. As of late, Pope Francis has been making headlines and encouraging controversy with his recent declaration that gives permission to priests to bless gay couples.

While many have accused the pontiff of opening the door to a future that endorses same-sex marriage, allies are insisting that this is not the case. The issue here is quite technical and nuanced.

To unravel it all we called upon Ryan Di Corpo, a protege of Fr. James Martin (an advocate encouraging dialogue on this issue who has appeared on Common Threads several times). Ryan has a great understanding of the history of how the Church has dealt with this hot-button topic and where they may go from here.

Ryan Di Corpo is the managing editor of Outreach. A former Joseph A. O’Hare, S.J., fellow at America, his work has appeared in The Washington Post, Boston College Magazine, The Emancipator and elsewhere. He holds a B.A. in film from Fordham University and an M.A. in journalism from Northeastern University, in Boston.

He has been interviewed by several outlets, including Newsweek, the National Catholic Reporter and The Washington Times. He is originally from Massachusetts. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Meditation for Mediocre Mystics Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A cynic might chalk this up to a bit of nepotism, but I would protest. Tom Stella, my cousin, has made more appearances on Common Threads than any other guest. But aside from the sharing of DNA, Tom continues to explore the deeper parts of spirituality in which so many find resonance. In these 2 episodes we discuss his latest book "Meditation for Mediocre Mystics." 

Tom was ordained a Catholic priest at Notre Dame in 1972; an event I'm pleased to say I witnessed. He currently serves as a chaplain, retreat leader, spiritual advisor and author. Oh, and he continues to marry and bury a good number of members in his large extended Italian-American family. 

I suspect you'll enjoy this. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Jonestown and the Michigan Connection Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Even though it's been over 40 years, the memory of Jonestown and the massacre that ended it still haunts the American psyche. Few realize that the number of Americans killed on that fateful day is the highest right under the Twin Tower attacks of 9/11. Since the initial reporting of the event, little attention has been paid to any Michigan connections. Recently, MLive reporter Cole Waterman learned of a small group of citizens from various parts of the state who did meet their end in Guyana. He decided to focus on the life and death of one person in particular--Shirlee Fields. In this episode we discuss how Jonestown fascinated Cole, who was not yet born when this all happened. And we get a glimpse of a hometown girl who grew up with a passion to fight social injustice, but was ultimately led into a toxic cult that belied the ideals she held so strongly. Here are the 2 episodes where we featured Cole. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Joseph Smith &amp; The Golden Plates Parts 1 &amp;2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[One of the most contentious  issues of 19th Century Christian America revolved around the veracity of the story of Joseph Smith and his discovery of golden plates that became the foundation of the Book of Mormon. In these episodes we speak with Prof. Richard Bushman, whose book on this subject is perhaps the most detailed on the subject you'd want to see..  What piqued my interest is that while Dr. Bushman is a practicing Mormon, his academic credentials are impeccable. And he retired from Columbia University. This is interesting because so many academicians in the field of Religious Studies are actually quite secular. Above & beyond  the main focus of our conversation, I question him on what it's like to be a believer in a conservative religion in the midst of the liberal landscape of college campus. Listen to what he says. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Sitting In the Shade of Another Tree Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In these episodes we converse with 4 writers of religion who contributed to the now best selling book Sitting In the Shade of Another Tree. And yeah, I'm in it as well, but please don't hold that against the book and these fine  minds. We were all tasked with writing an essay on a religion not our own that we hold in high estimation for one reason or another. This is a very intimate look into the personal journeys of people who in most cases did not find much value in faiths outside of their fold. Great conversations. Listen! Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Follow Your Heartbreak Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[If you are a devotee of mythologist Joseph Campbell  you know his mantra for years was "follow your bliss." In the proper context, this can be a wonderful aspiration. However, some may take it at face value and end up living a rather selfish, vapid existence.  Fr. Adam Bucko turned this saying on its head by titling his book "Follow Your Heartbreak." By this he means that we can find great fulfillment by looking to serve those on the margins of society.  Believe me, this is a man that has been walking his talk for ages. Listen to this and be inspire to be the change you want to see.

      <itunes:summary>For Jews and Christians, the Sabbath is a very special time. Or at least is should be. For many, it&apos;s nothing more than a day off from work, if that. But there is a movement afoot to reclaim this restorative tradition. As one interviewee states, &quot;Jews don&apos;t have sacred space, they have sacred time.&quot;
As of this posting in 2023, many PBS TV stations are airing a documentary called &quot;Sabbath.&quot; In these episodes we discuss the backstory of the making of this impressive film with producer  Martin Doblmeier.

      <title>As I Lay Dying: Conversation with One Who Has Been There Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I am so pleased to have found yet another cassette tape in my basement from way back when that I'm thrilled to share. All signs point to these episodes being recorded in 2002. 

Fr.Richard Neuhaus, who died in 2009, was a force to be reckoned with in the conservative Catholic movement. He was the editor of 1st Things Magazine, a journal of social and religious right-of-center commentary. But we really didn't get into that sort of conversation. The focus here was on his book "As I Lay Dying." 

In recent times there have been more than a few books from Christians about personal experiences with their own death and some sort of afterlife journey. We've even talked about one such story that was embarrassingly debunked  by the author years later (Episodes 12 & 13: I Did Not Die & Go to Heaven). But Fr. Neuhaus speaks with a sense of gravitas that compels you to listen, even though belief is another matter.  I encourage you to give this a try. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Creating the Qur&apos;an Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[There are many people of faith who, upon maturing in their spiritual growth, become willing to view the stories that surround the origins of their religions as more allegorical than historical. Admittedly, it's perhaps more challenging to  find Muslims who are open to this understanding about their tradition than Jews or Christians. My understanding is that those Muslims who do question the historicity of the their scriptures tend to become ex-Muslims.  

In these episodes we explore how the Qur'an was created. As with all ancient religions, there is always a bit of a chasm between  what academia discovers through the historical process and what the faithful are taught to believe.  

Sometimes it gets tense.  Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[Every once in a while there will be episodes about projects that I've been personally involved in. This is that. These 2023 conversations are with Dr. Frank Tedesco of True Dharma International. He produced and directed a documentary that is intended to advise caregivers and medical personnel on providing comfort to those adherents in the Dharmic religions (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism) who are nearing the end of life. It is a very powerful and significant work. I am honored to have narrated this film.

      <title>The Life of a Pilgrim Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In the Hindu tradition there is the stage of life called Vanaprastha. It is when one retires from many family and professional responsibilities to dedicate more time to spiritual advancement. Our guest on these 2023 episodes is not Hindu, but Unitarian Universalist. Rev. W. Fred Wooden, and he is expressing this epoch in his life by pilgrimage.  He has traversed the globe, honoring multiple religious traditions as he walks the well trodden paths of our ancestors. 

Fred is a longtime friend of mine. At one point in his ministry he had a radio show of his own: Faith & Reason. I was a frequent guest. When I was we called the episode "Common Freds."

Much of our conversation here revolves around a recent pilgrimage he took in Japan. His reminiscences of that experience is recorded in the book "Basho and I Take a Long Walk." Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Attempting to Fight Bigotry with Bigotry: New American Caste Laws Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I suspect that no one who listens to Common Threads would support the oppressing of someone due to their social status or caste. So when we hear of colleges, towns, states, etc., passing legislation or resolutions that claim to protect those born in "low caste" families our initial response might be a positive one. But as our guests on these 2023 episodes indicate, this kind of thinking may have serious negative consequences for Americans of South Asian descent for years to come.  Theme music "Nigal."

So when we hear of colleges, towns, states, etc., passing legislation or resolutions that claim to protect those born in &quot;low caste&quot; families our initial response might be a positive one. But as our guests on these 2023 episodes indicate, this kind of thinking may have serious negative consequences for Americans of South Asian descent for years to come. </itunes:summary>

      <title>Polarization in Society and the Church Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[We hear and read about how this country is so deeply polarized. The problem is that there is clearly one side that has made a cottage industry out of demonizing the "other side." While there are crazy makers on the left side of the spectrum, it is clearly those who subscribe to a Trumpian philosophy that are doing the most damage. 
In these episodes we speak with Fr. Aaron Wessman, the author of "The Church's Mission in a Polarized World." While the focus of the book is directed toward Christians, people of any faith can profit by the strategies laid out in this work. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Ali The Iraqi: A Muslim in the House of Mormon Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Years ago the US Government was anxious to resettle Iraqi citizens temporarily in the USA whom they thought had significant leadership qualities. Their purpose was to begin their nation building in a post-Saddam society with returning these men and women in time for a turn toward an American friendly democratic republic. 

Josh Sobey's family, who are all members of the LDS, agreed to house Ali, a high school student from Iraq. This book is an excellent account of that episode in the lives of Josh and Ali. They collaborated on an effort that is part fiction, part true. For the most part, it's up to us  to parse the real from the not-so-real. We do get a few clues here in these conversations. Regardless, it's a great read. Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[For the past couple of decades conservatives have been planning and executing a takeover of our court systems. For some odd reason, Democrats have not paid as much attention to this. Thus we are experiencing a significant sea change in American juris prudence. What does this mean to how religion is expressed in this country? A great deal. The term "religious liberty" has been, in some instances, turned on its head. In these 2 episodes from 2023 we speak with Alan Brownstein, a constitutional lawyer and professor. His insights are valuable. Listen. Vote. Repeat. Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[It is so painful to know of the brilliant legacy of Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism and other paths in China that flourished, and see how religion is so under siege today. And along with these indigenous traditions we can see how Islam and Christianity are also under attack.

Dr. Kelly Clark has done extensive research in China over the the years. He's finally published  "A Spiritual Geography of Early Chinese Thought: Gods, Ancestors and Afterlife." These episodes contain our conversations. The story is both uplifting and sad. Listen, gentlefolk. Listen.

      <title>East Winds: A Global Quest to Reconcile Marriage Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Remember back in the day when almost from birth a girl was groomed to become a wife? If so, I'm impressed that you're still alive, because I'm pretty old myself, and I have only the vaguest memories of that world. But in certain cultures this still stands. In these episodes with author Rachel Rueckert, we discuss the challenges of growing up in the LDS with an almost absolute expectation that marriage & motherhood are pretty much the only options in front of you. 

Rachel offers a very thoughtful personal history of her life, and how she has met and continues to challenge the status quo--all while navigating a successful marriage. 
Hear how the old Mormon tradition of polygamy still influences the religion today. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Interfaith Marriage: Jumping the Hurdles Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Sociologists tell us that marriages tend to be more successful when certain commonalities are present. Religion is one of them. But we all know that marrying outside of one's faith is much more commonplace than in the days of yore. So how do we navigate such unions? One way is to have honest conversations about the challenges that might erupt between spouses.  And things that weren't even considered when planning a wedding all of a sudden require attention when children enter the picture.

In these 2022 episodes we discuss these matters with the author of "Interfaith Shaadi."  Dilip Amin has been counseling couples of different religions for decades now.  His approach is sympathetic, but he does not shy away from the realities of family life when religious concerns appear.   Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[There is something special about having access to the private correspondence between thoughtful, literate and spiritually evolved individuals.  Mark Taylor and  Jack Miles are 2 such people. During the Covid lockdown they wrote to one another regularly. Their insights into religion, politics, life, death and everything in between are compelling and thought provoking. These letters appear in the book A Friendship in Twilight: Lockdown Conversations on Death and Life.  In these 2022 episodes we chat with Dr. Miles about this armchair adventure.

      <title>Leaving Islam Parts ! &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Some people just walk away from their faiths of birth with no hard feelings. They just...stop. No issues, no problems. But some religions or denominations do make it a challenge. And leaving can have significant challenges. In the past we've exposed the hard work that many who have left Jewish Hasidim communities have had to do as they attempt to reenter mainstream society. In these 2 episodes we speak with Yasmine Mohammed, the educator and author who currently lives in Canada. She challenges both conservative Muslims and those non-Muslims who are afraid to condemn the anti-liberal values of Wahabism  in fear of being labeled Islamophobic. 

One of the most powerful stories told on Common Threads. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Khalistan: Anatomy of Terror Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[There are several forces at work to break up India into separate ethno-religious states. The odd thing here is that the vast majority of Sikhs in the Punjab really enjoy being Indian. Yet, there is a small minority that want to create Khalistan, a Sikh theocracy. However, the real problem is that a large number of Sikhs in North America are strong backers of the idea; including those who would honor terrorists who would further their cause.

However, the real problem is that a large number of Sikhs in North America are strong backers of the idea; including those who would honor terrorists who would further their cause.

Terry Milewski is an award winning journalist who has covered this story for over a decade. In these episodes we discuss his book Blood for Blood. </itunes:subtitle>

      <description><![CDATA[As I say in the beginning of Part 1, I met Lisa at the Council on Foreign Relations conference on Religion & Foreign Policy in 2016. We reconnected at the same event in 2022. Our conversations are expansive, covering everything from her forebears' experience with slavery and indentured servitude, the race issues of today and both the positive and negative effects religion on racial issues and democracy itself. 

Lisa's latest book is "Fortune." Great read.  Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Medium &amp; The Minister Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[You don't have to 'be religious' to believe there may be a life after death.

 The Medium and the Minister explores psychical and religious approaches to the possibility of an afterlife. The tensions and conflicts between these 2 approaches and the heated controversies they have generated are illustrated by a number of case studies. These focus on the challenges posed by psychical research and spiritualism to orthodox religion as the ultimate authority for information and teaching about the afterlife. Prominence is given initially to the campaigns of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Sir Oliver Lodge which aimed to publicize the psychical evidence and to the Church’s reaction to them. Later developments and initiatives to try to reconcile the opposing positions are then examined in the light of further psychical research. The issues raised are shown to be still highly relevant to current beliefs and attitudes and to the question of what might constitute evidence for life after death.

Roger Straughan is a  delight to speak with. Enjoy Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Is Wokeism Becoming a Religion? Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Close to the top of Culture War issues is the concept of Wokeism. It's such a loaded word. And the thing is, it not only riles those on the right, but can be a pain for more progressive people as well. I admit to cringing when I hear people refer to "menstruating people" when referring to those liable to get pregnant. I find  "women" is much more pleasant to the ear.  
James Patterson is on the right side of the political/social spectrum. But his ideas are not off the cliff. He does ask a serious questions about identity politics and the larger culture. 
Listen, learn, comment. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>From Jerusalem to Delhi Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[At 1st glance, it would seem that Jews and Hindus have very little in common. Judaism is known as one of "the great monotheistic religions of the world." How can there be much to talk about with a religion that purportedly has 330,000,000 gods & goddesses? Well, it seems that besides the fact that some of the most devout Hindus have been Jews, there really is much philosophically that binds these seemingly opposite traditions. 

In her new book "From Jerusalem to Delhi Through Persia" author Susan Adelman provides a very detailed analysis of the attraction of Jews to Eastern Thought, as well as the solid relationship between Israel and India.  You will enjoy this one. So listen. I won't take no for an answer! Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Hindu and Black Americans: An Important Alliance in Civil Rights Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When we think about the religious communities that offered assistance to the civil rights struggles of the past and present, we don't usually think of Hindus. There is a good reason for that. Nonetheless, there is a connection. 

In these March 2022 episodes we examine the bridges between the 2 cultures with educator Murali Balaji. Most important is the influence Gandhi had on King and his nonviolent movement.  

Good shows. Listen & learn! And Dr. Balaji's online article "Why Hindus Should Celebrate Black History Month" is a great read to accompany this. Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[As I mention in the introduction to Part 1, it is rare that you find someone from the theist crowd acknowledging that the other camp has something important to say. I was impressed with this book's author in that he does exactly that. Admittedly, many famous atheists pepper their arguments with a good deal of venom. Scott handles this tactic well. 

Scott Shay is the co-founder and Chairman of Signature Bank, well known as one of the best banks in New York for private business owners. He earned a BA in Economics and a Masters in Management from Northwestern University

Scott is a distinguished leader in the Jewish community and an avid student of religion and its application to the world outside of the synagogue, church, or mosque. In addition to ‘In Good Faith’ Scott Shay is the author of Conspiracy U and Getting Our Groove Back: How to Energize American Jewry. Scott lives in New York City.

      <itunes:subtitle>I recall really enjoying these 2006 conversations with Rev. Stephen Bauman, who is a pastor for a church in NYC. We discuss the rewards &amp; challenges of being a spiritual leader in the city that never sleeps. By the way, this is the last old cassette that I&apos;ve been able to find in my basement.

      <title>The Growing Power of Christian Nationalism Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Since Trump never went away like a good ex-president should, we must continue to be vigilant, as his hapless followers are determined to wreak havoc on our democracy. There are many strains of this toxicity. One of the most pernicious is the Christian Nationalism movement. It just ain't going away. 
In these 2 episodes from March 2022 we speak with Rev. Nathaniel Manderson. He's a Baptist minister who is working hard to make a case that Evangelicals should not support this oppressive, bigoted movement.

      <title>Krishna Consciousness Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I am just about done with digitizing these old cassette copies of episodes from the ancient past. I have no honest idea as to the air dates of these. I suspect we're talking about the very early years of the new century. Sometime between 2000-05? Probably.  The 1st part is a conversation with Srivas Das, one of the early pioneers of the Hare Krishna movement in Ghana & other African countries. Here we discuss the very basics of Vaishnavism, the branch of Hinduism that Krishna devotees represents. 

By the way, the Hare Krishna movement is explored in more detail in Episode 35 & 90.

The 2nd part features Naraharidev Das. This one has a distinct local flavor, as our guest had recently moved to Grand Rapids and hoped to establish a center here. That never materialized, but the ashrams in the Detroit area occasionally  send  people here to conduct programs. Please ignore any phone numbers given. Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[We are now hearing and reading about a subject that has been thrown in the back of the closet for decades. The question before us is: Should the descendants of slaves be compensated for the invaluable contributions that their ancestors made to the growth of the USA in our formative years? The various positions taken on this issue come from the arenas of politics, social justice and economics. Here we address it from the standpoint of religion.  Our guest for these episodes from 2021  is Gregory Thompson, the author of the book "Reparations: A Christian Call for Repentance & Prayer" Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>A Good Way to Die: The Moonies Who Worship Guns Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Back in the 70s, a religious punchline often included "The Moonies." That's what members of the Unification Cult were called, in reference to their messy messiah Sun Myung Moon. We haven't heard much of them as of late, but they hardly disappeared. Well, Moon died (What? No resurrection?), and now a battle is taking place between Moon's widow and 2 of her sons who are allied against her. And here's the scary part: These whack-jobs have started  their own right-wing death cult where the AR-15 is considered a sacramental, used in worship services like Catholics might use a rosary. 

Sorry to say, this is scary stuff. But it needs to be said. Our guest Jordan Green has done a great job on providing what we need to know about this latest iteration of a Trump inspired dystopia.  Let's do what we can to reverse course. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Making of Biblical Womanhood Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In November of 2021 Calvin University presented an online conference that focused on how Evangelical Christianity has, over time, defined just what made a woman "godly." Needless to say, in this 21st century there has been a movement among women to deconstruct these notions and replace them with what many would call a more enlightened understanding. 

In these episodes we speak with the author of the book The Making of Biblical Womanhood, Beth Allen Barr just prior to the Calvin event. She's not afraid to do a little boat rockin', that's for sure. 

Enjoy Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Hildegard of Bingen: Mysticism Today Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[These are wonderful conversations that I had in 2021 with author Susan Garthwaite. We discuss the wisdom of St. Hildegard, a 12th century mystic who was a woman of great regard by the Catholic Church. These days her influence spreads far beyond denominations. 

What's interesting when speaking to people like Susan, who struggle between cultivating the great spiritual tradition that birthed and raised them, yet are often at odds with the institution.  Listen & enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <itunes:summary>These are wonderful conversations that I had in 2021 with author Susan Garthwaite. We discuss the wisdom of St. Hildegard, a 12th century mystic who was a woman of great regard by the Catholic Church. These days her influence spreads far beyond denominations. 

What&apos;s interesting when speaking to people like Susan, who struggle between cultivating the great spiritual tradition that birthed and raised them, yet are often at odds with the institution.  Listen &amp; enjoy.</itunes:summary>

      <title>The Kashmir Files Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The movie The Kashmir Files  was slated for a massive release in India in January of 2022. Due to Covid it is being held back. Here in the US there were some private screenings in major metro areas. While I did not see the film myself, several friends did, and were very encouraging when I told them I'd be speaking with director Vivek Agnihotri.  This was a powerful conversation about one of the world's most painful experiences in the late 20th century, and the reverberations we are still feeling. So until The Kashmir Files is released, we must be satisfied with offerings such as this. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>SpiritualPerspectives on Globalism Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I do take great pains to correctly ID the year of original broadcast of these oldies; but remember, they all came out of 2 big boxes sequestered in my basement. Very few had any markings on the cassette tape itself or the cover. Much of the time I can tell the timeline when I interview an author. We normally bring them on very close to the release date of their book, which is easily found. But sometimes that isn't the case.  That is probably true with these excellent episodes on globalism.

The book came out in 2002. I was just about to call it good, but then I hear our guest make reference to the US military raid of Saddam's palace. We didn't invade Iraq until '03, we must have aired these after that. Let's call it 2003, with the chance it might be '04. 

Close enough. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Imagining God: Religion as Metaphor Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[We're taking a break from uploading shows from The Vault of the Ancients to bring you 2 episodes that aired in early 2022. Here we converse with Prof. Humberto Casanova, a Chilean theologian. Mr. Casanova has impeccable credentials in the school of Reformed theology. But his thinking as taken a turn toward the more progressive end of Christianity. In his book Imagining God he examines the poetry, mythology and metaphor that permeate The Bible. While to some this kind of thinking somehow "diminishes" the status of Holy Writ, for others, a book like this can be a lifeline to a refreshed faith.

Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Habits of the High Tech Heart Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I chortled more than a bit listening to these 2002 episodes. Our guest Quentin Shultze discusses how to engage with new technology from a moral & ethical foundation. But think about where we were then & where we are now. It would be like hearing a discourse on the automobile from 1915 20 years later. 

So, here we discuss computers, cell (but not smart!) phones, e-dating in its infancy, and this whole new thing we now call social media before it even had a term.  It seems like such a revelation when Dr. Schultze tells me that neo-Nazis are posting hate speech online.  I've mentioned before how I enjoy reading old magazines & newspapers to see where we were and where we are now. Well, this is that. So put down your palm pilot, crank up your computing machine & enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>A Global Guide to Interfaith Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[These are 2 episodes from 2008, where I speak with contributors to the book A Global Guide to Interfaith, which came out the previous year. I've mentioned before that for a program with the word "Interfaith" in its title, we don't really examine actual interfaith movements all that often. We did near the beginning, back in the 1990s. But feedback has been almost unanimously favorable on our decision to widen the parameters. 

Episode #1 here has us talking to Dena Merriam, a well known interfaith activist who is now on the board of directors of Hindu American Foundation. Episode #2 is with Allison VanDyke, with the Temple of Understanding in NYC. Each of these remarkable women wrote essays for the book.

      <title>The Dynamics of Judeo-Christian Relationships in the Middle Ages Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[If you're familiar with our vault of classic episodes, you're aware of the fact that in the past we've interviewed several wonderful authors within the genre of historical fiction to discuss religion, culture and literature of the middle ages. Here is an especially interesting couple of shows that aired in the early 00s. This time, our guest is not an author herself, but an academic who reviews books that share these themes. Susan Weintrob brings great insight into the relationships between Jews & Christians in medieval Europe. She dispels some myths along the way as well.

      <description><![CDATA[This one is a real oldie. Back in 2002 we held our annual interfaith conference, with the theme of environmentalism. We shared the duties with the West Michigan Environmental Action Committee. So remember, all this happened a long time ago. Don't go trying to register for it. But like all of these ancient episodes, the conversation is still valid. Our guest is Dr. John Grim. You'll hear how good he is at what he does. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>A Vedantic Interpretation of the Gospels by Sri Yogananda Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I'm very pleased to find the cassette that had these 2005 episodes on it. I didn't think I would. Here I enjoy a conversation with Swami Chidananda, one of the main editors that worked intensely on the Gospel commentaries written over the span of many years by Paramhansa Yogananda.  The noted Hindu mystic saw the Judeo-Christian scriptures through a Vedantic lens that is quite close to that of some sects of the ancient Gnostics. I'm speculating, of course; but I get the idea that if Emerson or Thoreau had access to the pages of this book ("The 2nd Coming of Christ") they might say, "Yes! That's what Jesus was trying to say!"

It was an honor to speak to Chidananda. Aside from being a wonderful person in his own right, in 2017 he assumed the presidency of Self Realization Fellowship, becoming the spiritual successor to Yogananda.  Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Inner work of Age  Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[We have such an interesting relationship with age here in the US. We tend to worship youth and disregard the wisdom and life experience that comes with more candles on the cake. Of course, it's also possible to gain years and stupidity. Think of the audiences who rely on Tucker and Sean for their news analysis. 

But I digress...

In these episodes from 2022 we speak to therapist and spiritual advisor Connie Zwieg. We discuss the need to re-frame the concept of aging. Among her ideas,  we must look upon  those up in years as honored Elders, as more traditional societies do.  And those who reach advanced years should commit to sharing their gifts with the world; not just rack up more time on the golf course. 

Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Interfaith Conference on Science &amp; Religion 1999</title>
      <description><![CDATA[OK, if you skip this one you're forgiven.  I'm still going through a big box of ancient shows, and the other day i came across this cassette. It is not an episode of Common Threads, but a recording of a conference we held on 11/6/1999. The problem is that this is a very, very BAD recording. I think someone just set up a tape recorder in the back of the room and hoped for the best.

Some portions are easier to hear than others, but the big disappointment is that the keynote address by Brother Wayne Teasdale is perhaps the worst sounding of all the speakers. You might want to try to listen, but I suspect many will give up, and I don't blame them. Believe me, I almost just tossed this one. But it is a piece of IDA history. And the good news is that for some reason, Wayne's fidelity improves during Q&A.

For those who are not familiar with Br. Wayne Teasdale, he became quite an iconic figure in the interfaith arena during the 80s, 90s and early 00s. He died much too young in 2004. During this time he was a great friend of IDA. So if no one listens that's OK. This will stand as "silent" tribute.

      <title>Revenge: A Story of Hope &amp; Forgiveness Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[These 2 episodes were used to promote our interfaith conference in 2003. So please remember to ignore all references to the information I share. Even thought the event is long past the story of our guests bears repeating. In the 1980s Rabbi David Blumenfeld  was shot by a terrorist. He survived, and lived to forgive his attacker, who then renounced violence. 

Episode 1 is a conversation with David's daughter Lauren, who wrote a book about the experience titled "Revenge: A Story of Hope."

Episode 2 is with Rabbi Blumenfeld himself. 

Both are worth listening to. Theme music "Nigal."

      <itunes:summary>These 2 episodes were used to promote our interfaith conference in 2003. So please remember to ignore all references to the information I share. Even thought the event is long past the story of our guests bears repeating. In the 1980s Rabbi David Blumenfeld  was shot by a terrorist. He survived, and lived to forgive his attacker, who then renounced violence. 

Episode 1 is a conversation with David&apos;s daughter Lauren, who wrote a book about the experience titled &quot;Revenge: A Story of Hope.&quot;

Episode 2 is with Rabbi Blumenfeld himself. 

Both are worth listening to.</itunes:summary>

      <description><![CDATA[I'm pretty sure this episode is from 2004. Our guest is John Rao from the Theosophical Society. I really enjoyed listening to this right now. John, as I recall, was really a good guy. He gave much of himself to his path. 
As I do a great deal of the time, when I come across an old cassette to digitize and upload I check to see what might have come of our dear guest. To save you the work I can say that by my searches there are no traces of a West Michigan chapter of the Theosophists. The website is no longer valid. I did not try the phone number. 
Regardless, I think you'll enjoy this conversation  as well. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>You Never Call You Never Write: A History of Jewish Mothers Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[While I try to tackle a wide variety of subjects with equal interest, it's easy to tell which subjects really excite me. Just look through the archives to see how many times I revisit a subject. I just came across these 2007 episodes and realized that I'd done a total of 6 episodes (3 guests doing 2 episodes each) on Jewish humor. I don't believe there are any more, but I still have a few more old cassette tapes to digitize and upload. 
So enjoy, why not? Joyce Antler is our guest. She authored the book "You Never Call You Never Write." And keep in mind that this isn't just a collection of jokes. Joyce takes a serious look at how Jewish women impacted American culture. But there are a few laughs along the way. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Gospel According to Buffy Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Recently we posted the episodes that focused on The Gospel According to The Simpsons. This week I came across a show we did a year later (2004) with Jana Riess, the author of "What Would Buffy Do?" This book follows along the same lines, seeking the deep spirituality that is embedded in the series. 

I was never really a fan of the show, though I always thought Sarah Michelle Gellar was quite fetching.  Regardless, I think we had a great conversation over these episodes. So all you children of the 90s, enjoy. 

Oh, I checked for myself. www.whatwouldbuffydo.net no longer exists.

      <title>Conversations with the Brilliant Rabbi David Rosen on All Things Interfaith Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[These episodes are really among my favorites. Aired in 2008, we hosted Rabbi David Rosen, a gent with an impressive resume. 
David Shlomo Rosen  is the former Chief Rabbi of Ireland and currently serves as the American Jewish Committee's International Director of Interreligious Affairs. He has participated in some of the world's more seachanging conferences in the arena of multi-faith  engagement. In these conversations David and I discuss, among other things, the major interfaith event that was convened in Spain under the direction of King Abdullah, then the monarch of Saudi Arabia. 
I'm pleased to say that in the 20+ years we've produced Common Threads we've hosted many brilliant minds. This is an example of that. Listen or lose out. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Gospel According to The Simpsons Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[One of my favorites! In these 2 episodes I speak to Mark Pinsky, the author of The Gospel According to The Simpsons, which aired in 2001. Not only insightful, but a lot of fun. OK, I'm a bit biased, as before publication Mark reached out to me. I am quoted in the book.
And here's something of a bonus track. As you might suspect, when I say goodbye to a guest on air, we normally chat for another minute or so off air. Sometimes that is caught on tape. This happened here, & the short conversation is really great. He discusses his next book about religion & Disney.   What kills me is that though you'll hear me say that we'll interview him when that is published, it never happened. Stupid me. We did, however, get him back a few years later to discuss his book "A Jew Among the Evangelicals." That is his account of being a religion editor for a paper in Florida. I hope I still have that one. Stay tuned. But to catch this short interchange LISTEN PAST THE CLOSING THEME OF PART 2. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Removing the Obstacles of Life Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I haven't counted how many episodes we've posted so far with the esteemed teacher Swami Bodhanada. Well, here are 2 more. These aired in 2004. As always, please ignore any promotions for events that are included in our conversations. Also featured here is Dr. Ruth Harring, a remarkable scholar in her own right. 
Very few are able to explain the non-dual philosophy of Vedanta with such clarity as Swamiji. Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>An American Woman Fights for the Soul of Islam Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[If you've been listening long enough to Common Threads you know that we champion the cause of liberal religion of all stripes. Here we discuss Islam and the challenges its adherents are faced with from a very conservative all-male leadership. In these 2005 episodes we speak with Asra Nomani, a thorn in the side of the Muslim establishment in the USA. Hers is a harrowing tale that could easily have sent someone else to convert to another faith. But Nomani does believe in the tenets of the religion of her birth, and is passionate about seeing it expressed as she believes was intended. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Physics &amp; Judaism Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Many, if not most, religionists will claim that their faith is supported by science. The problem is, most scientists look upon these claims with a very skeptical eye, as they should. But some who speak from wisdom are able to make claims that really should be heard, contemplated and given respect. The work of Rabbi David Nelson would fall into this category.  Listen and learn.

David Nelson spent much of his early life portraying himself in a popular family sitcom in the 1950s. He later converted to Judaism and....oh, wait. What. OK. Never mind. Originally aired in 2005. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Beyond Prisons to Restorative Justice Parts 1 &amp;2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A few things can be taken for granted about our penal system. For one, much of how we punish and/or rehabilitate prisoners is based on rather ancient codes. Also, religion has strongly impacted how we think about punishment. In these 2006 episodes my guests & I discuss how we can move away from a system that seems to work only sometimes, to a place of restorative justice that from all accounts, produces better outcomes--that is, less recidivism. 

Good stuff, Maynard. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Getting On Message: Attempting to Defeat the Religious Right During Bush Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Do you know how many times I've heard people ringing the death knell for the religious right? The 1st time was during a sermon given by a Unitarian minister in the 1980s. 

Yeah, How'd that work out?

Even during the GW Bush years pundits were claiming that the movement would be short-lived.  And during the Obama years the very naive thought that the Tea Party replaced the Evangelicals with a message of economics over "morality."  In no time at all the 2 forces allied to give Obama the shellacking  of his life in the midterms. 

This is why I post all these old episodes. They tell us where we were, and we are able to see how we got to now. Little did we know in 2006 when we aired these conversations with Rev. Peter Laarman about his book "Getting On Message" that the frustrations we were experiencing then by the likes of Focus on the Family, Jerry Falwell and that ilk would pale in comparison to what we had waiting in the wings a decade later with Trump & his misguided minions. 

Listen. Ponder. Hope. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>That Reminds Me of a Story: Jewish Humor on Stage Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I was thrilled to find this cassette in the box of old shows. These episodes aired toward the end of 1999. My guest was also a very dear friend named Don Herman. Don passed away in 2019. He meant a lot to my wife & me. His wife Bluma is still a part of our lives.  In 1997 Jewish Theatre Grand Rapids staged a play Don wrote called "That Reminds Me of a Story." It was collection of brilliant examples of classic Jewish Humor. 

Back in 2020 I revisited the world of Jewish humor again. Check out Podcast #113 for that. But this is the original.

One other note: On these cassettes that I'm digitizing & uploading there are sorts of sounds such as mic checks, countdowns from my engineer, a word or so from my guest, etc. As you would expect, I edit those out for these podcasts. Well, there are a couple sweets remarks by Don immediately before & after the episodes that I couldn't bring myself to cut. So here we go, all the way. Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Matching You to Your Path Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed conversing with these co-authors Sandra Hirsh & Jane Kise about their book "Soul Types: Matching Your Personality to Your Spiritual Path." They have devised a testing practice based on the well known Myers Briggs formula that they claim allows one to find a tradition, religion, practice, etc. that seems to resonate.  I was impressed with their research. It made for a good discussion. 1st aired in 2006. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Making of Hajj: A Personal Pilgrimage Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a 2-part conversation with my friend Ali Metwalli from 2001. It is an in-depth explanation of the meaning and logistics of Hajj, the Quran mandated pilgrimage to Mecca that every Muslim who able to must make at least once in a lifetime.  Here we are 20 years later, and Ali & I still collaborate on interfaith projects. As I'm writing this we're working on the annual interfaith Thanksgiving worship service that will take place a few nights before the holiday. Good man.</p><p>Remember, this audio comes from a 20-year old cassette tape. Forgive the not great fidelity.</p>

      <title>Mission &amp; Menace; 4 Centuries of American Zealotry Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Sadly, we have lost significant ground here in the US since these episodes were 1st broadcast in 2009. We were just coming out of what most would call a disastrous  presidency of GW Bush. We were so very hopeful with the incoming Obama administration. But fundamentalism, racism & a distorted sense of nationalism fomented. It laid the groundwork for an even more chilling 4 years of Trumpism.  Our author guest Robert Jewett provides solid history and research to back his view of the overarching zealotry that has motivated so much of America over the centuries. 

By just changing a few words here & there I suspect we could do this whole thing over again today and still be relevant. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Marriage Beyond Black, White &amp; Baha&apos;i Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In these 2002 conversations I discuss how the Baha'i faith deals with issues of race. Unlike most other religions, the Bahai's really go out of their way to promote interracial couplings.David is that author (with his wife Barbara)  of "Marriage Beyond Black & White." I recall telling the story of my father's discovery while jogging recently. I'd forgotten that I told it here. It had a real impact on me, as you'll hear. But you gotta listen, of course.

      <title>The RSS and Hindu Nationalism: Truth from Fiction Part 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[If you consume mainstream media here in the US you might get the impression that the Rastriya Swayamsevak Sangh is the Hindu equivalent of ISIS. I've known for a while that they weren't getting a fair shake, but didn't know anyone who could refute the common narrative. Then I came across Dr. Walter Andersen, a scholar specializing in South Asian Studies. His credentials are impressive, as you'll hear. If you do have any preconceived notions of what the RSS is, do give this a listen. These episodes aired on WGVU in the autumn of 2021 Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Emracing the Mystery: Spirit Beyond the Walls Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Earlier on in our history we hosted a lot more shows on inner spirituality; the kind of thing you hear listening to "On Being." Nowadays I turn down about 90% of the requests I get for themes like this. As you can probably see by later episodes, we are much more interested in how religion and spirituality intersect with society. 

All that said, I do remember enjoying these 2004 conversations with Meredith Jordan, the author of "Embracing the Mystery." No real surprises here, but it is interesting to remember the landscape of the day. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Faith Based Initiatives: Why &amp; Why Not Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I believe this all started in 2004, when I was asked to write an article. You'll hear all about it in the introduction. I can't remember just how I found our guest. Kate Lynns has, as you will hear, an impressive resume. I'm really quite surprised that I can't seem to find her online today. I always like knowing what happened to my guests from years past. Regardless of her status today, I think you will find this an extraordinary conversation. She makes a great case opposing GW Bush's policy of Faith Based Initiatives. 
Listen. And hey, if you do run into Kate, let her know I'm looking for her. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Once Again, Christianity &amp; LGBT Issues Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[If you have been through much of the catalogue that we've got posted from the vault you'll notice at least 3 or 4 episodes that deal with LGBT & Christianity. It seems like a lot, I know. But things really evolved in the past 2 decades, and I wanted to document the prevailing attitudes over time. These conversations were with Rev. Steve Bohlert, who is in the archives telling about his fascinating spiritual journey from beatnik, hippie, Hindu monk to Church of Christ minister.  Steve always makes for great conversation. So even if you have heard more that you need  about the subject, I think you'll enjoy this. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Interspirituality: What Works, What Doesn&apos;t Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The most important thing to know about these episodes is that in the beginning of Part 1 I seem to confuse the word "apophatics" with Appomattox. Please know it was a joke. I do that now and then.  My wife has asked me more than once why I go out of my way to have people believe I'm an idiot. Sorry, but sometimes getting a laugh trumps my dignity.

Anyway, this is a good 2-part discussion with Dr. Kenneth Rose. We discuss the ins and outs of mixing n' matching in the realm of religion. What can fit into one's spiritual life without diluting the tradition of choice? Listen, rinse, repeat. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Paganism, Pride &amp; Prejudice  Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I think these conversations were 1st broadcast in September of 2002. My guess is that this was the initial investigation into Pagan movements that we ever did on Common Threads.  A Pagan Pride festival was soon to be held, so we used this to promote the event. As always, please note that websites, phone numbers, etc., have no bearing today. But I hope you enjoy this. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>A Christian becomes Jewish, Exploring Sufism</title>
      <description><![CDATA[OK, this was funny. I interviewed Mary a year or 2 before these episodes from 2005 on her experience as a Baptist studying Judaism.  When we reconnect for these broadcasts she tells me that at some point during the process of her studying Sufism, she converts to Judaism. But the book was written (as I recall) while she was still a Christian. So all during my line of questioning I have to treat her like a Christian, even though she confided to me about her conversion. I hope I'm clear. 
Regardless of all that, I did enjoy our discussions. I expect you will too. 
Oh, Mary Blye Howe is now Mary Blye Keller. She  switched more than religions, I guess. Theme music "Nigal."

I do remember that someone put me in touch with this very sweet man, Fridoon Rahimi. A dedicated Baha'i, he took on a personal mission of transmitting a sense of morality and character.

      <title>To Hell With Hell Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[While I do respect the power, history & impact of all religions. I have to admit that I have a very hard time with the concept of Hell as it is portrayed in Christian and Muslim theology. Others may have similar dark afterlife regions, but often there is the option of redemption in the future. Well, one of my favorite guests over the years, Brian McLaren, wrote a book that came out in 2005 called "The Last Word & the Word After That." He's certainly not the 1st Christian leader to question perdition, but the fact that he identifies as Evangelical Christian makes him rare.  I loved these conversations. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Living Islam Out Loud: Muslim Women Acting Outrageously Parts 1 &amp;2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The book this was based on was impressive. As I say in the intro, I had no idea it would be so....well, sassy. Selema Addul Gafoor collects essays from various American Muslim women that explores behavior that would result in severe physical punishment if discovered in some Islamist societies. There is a lot of stereotype-busting ammo here. 

These 2005 episodes were really enlightening. Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

Well, as I continue to dig through all these old cassettes that I'm digitizing, lo & behold, I find the very 1st shows we recorded. At this time, in 2000, Tom had his 1st book in mind. The working title was The Essence of Us. When it finally hit print it became The God Instinct.  Keep in mind that all contact information  is probably not valid today.
 This was a lot of fun to do. I'm very pleased that these episodes were saved. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>In Good Faith: Questioning Religion &amp; Atheism Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[As I state in my introduction, this is a remarkable book in that while it does strongly argue from a theist's viewpoint, it gives the other side a great deal of respect. Author Scott Shay has no problem giving credit where it's due when secularists express concern about the behavior of those who claim to be monotheists. 

The book is written in a style that will appeal to hard core academics & theologians, as well as the less wonky. Scott comes from a Jewish perspective, but I'm sure  Christians & Muslims will appreciate this as well. I will say that his superficial understanding of Dharmic faiths doesn't do them justice, but if he did the book might be twice the size.

Really, give a listen to these episodes that aired in 2021. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Roadside Religion Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[One of the great things about the USA is our tradition of the road trip. Not just because we can get from one place to another with relative ease, but as we zoom through many parts of rural America we are able to observe many expressions of our quirky side. Case in point: Route 66. I've loved my time on what is left of the Mother Road. And what makes this special are the oddities and brilliant examples of human ingenuity. 

In his book Roadside Religion, Tim Beal shares with us his journey across the country as he records his experiences with organic displays of religious piety. Most of the time I have no problem that this is pure radio with no video. Here, I do wish otherwise. 1st aired in 2005. Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Eastern Rite Catholicism Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I would venture to say that most  Catholics have no idea that there is an Eastern Rite wing of their own church. That is, there are churches in North American & Europe that if a Catholic should enter, he would assume is Orthodox. So much of the ritual would be the same. Actually, an Orthodox Christian might feel more at home in such a church. But in this case, said church is 100% Catholic, fully in communion with Rome. 

These congregations observe many of the traditions of Orthodoxy. Priests can marry, iconography is important, and Sunday services are not called Masses, but Divine Liturgies.  

I don't recall what year these episodes aired, but certainly within the 1st few years of this century. The guests are Fr.Michael Bliszcz from St. Michael's Church in Grand Rapids, MI and Prof. Robert Marko, who at the time taught Religion at Aquinas College. I recall enjoying my conversations with these gentlemen. And I learned a lot. Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[If you've to enough episodes in our vault you've come across a few that feature Swami Bodhanada. The fact that he has an ashram about an hour from Grand Rapids always made him accessible. But what really makes him special is the width & breadth of his knowledge of Hinduism. He is able to define the nooks & crannies of it better than many, especially to people for whom this is new territory. These episodes originally aired in 2008.

      <description><![CDATA[Just a few episodes back we posted a couple of episodes entitled "Gnostic Yoga." I really wasn't thrilled with the scholarship behind the research our guest accomplished. So, I think we are redeeming ourselves this time. In 2003 we aired these interviews with Dr. Karen King, a very respected academic with a keen interest in the so called Gnostic Gospels. In these conversations Dr. King & I discuss the Gospel of Mary of Magdala.   I highly recommend this one.

      <title>Why Do We Believe in God(s) Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[If you have perused our vast collection of shows you may recall coming upon a few episodes promoting Grand Dialogue. That is a an (almost) annual event here in Grand Rapids. It's a conference that focuses on Science & Religion. I just found these episodes, & recall that this particular conference was one of my favorites.  The year was 2009. The keynote speaker was Brian Malley. And his topic was a fascinating one: Just why do we believe in gods, goddesses, higher powers, transcendence...

You can't not listen. I won't let you. Theme music "Nigal."

The keynote speaker was Brian Malley. And his topic was a fascinating one: Just why do we believe in gods, goddesses, higher powers, transcendence...

      <title>Christian Science Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Full disclosure: Sometimes I do interviews as favors. One of the challenges of hosting this program is that over the years I've gotten so many requests to profile certain people, events, etc. that in my heart of hearts I know will have little interest to our listeners.  Well, folks, this is an example of that. At the time we had a few Christian Scientists who were active in local interfaith programs. They were nice people, so when they came to me really excited that this speaker was coming to town, & asked me to interview her to promote her lecture, I said yes. Dang.

If you don't listen to this I won't feel hurt.  And you can FF the 1st 5 minutes when I spend it giving all the details of Ms. Fife's appearance locally.  This is from 2001. I was just getting my mojo. Oh, another thing...for some reason the sound quality is really poor. Another excuse for you to skip right over.

I am better at saying no to requests, by the way. But I have to admit that there have been a few times when I said yes to a suggestion & expected a stinker, but was greatly surprised with an excellent conversation. 

Ya never know. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>What Jesus Meant: Comments on the Beatitudes Parts 1 &amp; 2.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Listening to these  2007 episodes was enjoyable Clearly, some of these stand up to time better than others. In these conversations I speak with Erik Kolbell from Riverside Church in NYC. If you're not aware, Riverside has been sort of the flagship for American liberal congregations. And it's not too hard to spot a liberal Christian. They are the ones focusing on the beatitudes (the social gospel) as opposed to salvation, the main issue with conservatives. 

Do check this out.  I think you'll like where we take things. Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[I'm guessing that these episodes aired around 2003 or so. Not certain. Anyway, they were interesting conversations. But if you listen to me talk about our guest's various initiations and positions it sounds a bit overwhelming. I admit that I'm a bit skeptical about people who dip their toes in SO many spiritual traditions. But know that this is a personal bias. Judge for yourself. 

The thing that I find interesting is that he had multiple goals in establishing ministries to cater to those seeking more esoteric paths. It seems that nothing he offers here every panned out. In posting these old shows I often check the web to see where they are these days. My searches for John show almost nothing. And what I do see is all from the early 2000s.  Do keep this in mind when listening. None of the websites he offers is active.

To be clear, I am very interested in Gnostic teachings. You'll find other programs in our collection of shows that I think are more informative. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>From Believer to Zilch Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Boy, do I remember these. Ruth Tucker (our guest) is an interesting kinda lady. Case in point: Way back in 2002 when we aired these, someone on our team made contact with her via phone to set up a recording date. In conversation he happened to mention that he was born Christian, but now adheres to another religion. She just went ballistic on him. Now, I don't mean that she yelled or screamed, but according to him she was just relentless about rejoining the fold. And this is a guy who took his faith very seriously.  From what I recall, the call ended civilly and we proceeded.
But what you'll hear in these episodes is Ruth discussing her book "Walking Away From Faith." It details the spiritual journeys of those who left Christianity for Atheism. She does not investigate Christians who moved to other religions. But she really exposes herself honestly as one who regularly struggles with faith herself. 

Upon listening to this 20 year hence I find it interesting that both of us use "homosexual" to describe people rather than orientation. back then it was not much of an issue. Also, I'd love to know if she would refer to homosexuality as a sin if we were to speak to her today.  She seems sympathetic to gays, but it is clear that for her heterosexuality was a moral imperative. 

By the way, as much as Dr. Tucker & I disagree on most things theological, the school where she taught (Calvin Seminary here in Grand Rapids) treated her just horribly. You can find out more at www.ruthtucker.com if you're so inclined. There you will also find out about her horrific journey from spousal abuse to healing. Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[I remember the 1st time Tibetan monks came to Grand Rapids, MI  in the  1990s.for a series of lectures, meditations & rituals. The whole community was intrigued, and it made our local TV news. They started happening more frequently, so they got less attention. But every time they did visit us they brought great blessings. 

These episodes are from sometime in the early 2000s. Not only do we speak with Lama Kelsang here, but a young woman who married an ex-monk. Great exchange of ideas. Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>A Baptist Among the Jews Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I have to admit that when I 1st heard about this book I was concerned that it was a treatise on successful conversion practices. Turns out that it was nothing of the kind. Author Mary Blye Howe (now Keller) shares her journey as she discovered the wisdom of Judaism, allowing it to compliment her devout Christian practice. Along the way she gathered some great friends. These episodes from 2003 might inspire other Christians like Mary to explore the religion that became the foundation of their own faith.

However, sometime after this book came out I had another conversation with Mary. Turns out she could not resist the call of the shofar, and did convert to Judaism. Not only that, today she is an ordained rabbi. 

You will enjoy these these. I promise Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[If you scroll through the hundreds of episodes already up you'll find a couple dedicated to exploring Orthodox Christianity that were aired within the last couple of years. In discovering this recent treasure trove of old cassettes I found 2 episodes from the early 2000s that covered some of the same territory. But I think they are still worthwhile. My guests were 2 priests from Grand Rapids churches.  Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Medieval Murder Mysteries &amp; Religion Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I love well researched historical fiction. Most folks I know do as well. It occurred to a historian friend of mine that Common Threads might enjoy an interview with an author in such a genre. Obviously, any story that takes place in medieval Europe is going to be heavily influenced by the Christian church. This turned out to be a perfect fit. Author Margaret Frazer wrote a series of stories revolving around a detective-cum-nun that was quite popular, and very true to the time, Sr. Frevisse.

These shows aired in 2003.  Margaret died in 2013.  I'm grateful we had these conversations.

Here are 2 episodes Theme music "Nigal."

      <itunes:summary>For over 2,000 years if one professed to be a Christian it was a nonnegotiable that an unwavering belief in the literal resurrection of Jesus was part of the deal. Any movement from that position (at least publicly) could be very hazardous to your health. But in recent decades there has been a decided shift in solid obedience to that dogma by more liberal strains of Christianity. In 2005 the book  The Resurrection of Jesus: John Dominic Crossan and N. T. Wright in Dialogue was published. Former Catholic priest and liberal theologian converses with conservative Anglican NT Wright offer their contrasting views on this subject. In these 2 episodes we speak with Dr. Crossan in depth on new ways the Gospels  can still speak to adherents.</itunes:summary>

      <title>Exclusive Interview with ISIS Recruiter Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[OK, OK! Maybe not THAT ISIS. This is pretty funny, not to mention ironic. As I'm going through all these ancient programs from the early years (these are probably 2002 or 03) I find a cassette that I don't recall. It turns out to be a couple of episodes featuring Syed Misra from The Institute for the Secularization of Islamic Society. You know...ISIS. Is that not a stitch! It's really a great conversation. Here is someone who was raised in the religion explaining his longstanding issues with the religion. 

He does say a few things that I would challenge him on if I interviewed him today. I mean, he talks about Muslim nations, claiming that there is no such thing as a Christian or Jewish nation. Really? Ever hear of Israel? But the point is still valid that even in Israel the law of the land is not right out of the Bible. 
As with many of these old shows, the contact information isn't accurate.  While I can find information on ISIS online, I cannot find a functioning website. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Interfaith Alliance Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[OK Kids, this is one I found deep in the vault. I have no idea of the year, but I'm sure that these episodes aired around the turn of the century.  Our guest was Harry Kooyman, who lived here in West Michigan. Just moments ago I pulled him up on Facebook. From the pictures it looks like he has moved to more tropical climes. You can tell it's an oldie but goodie due to the fact that when Harry gives his phone# he doesn't include the area code, & that his e-dress is with AOL. 

The organization Interfaith Alliance, which is a response to Right-Wing Christian orgs, is still in existence, but the website has changed to www.interfaithalliance.org, & there is no longer a West Michigan chapter.  The closest is Chicago.

But I'm putting it up here, as I really enjoyed the discussions, & support their mission. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>TheEncyclopdia of Sex Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[As much as I enjoy sex (ahem...I mean discussing it academically, of course), I wouldn't have produced these episodes unless the subject matter was somehow related to religion/spirituality. And it turns out that this is a perfect fit. Our guest is Fr. Robert Francouer. Yes, that Fr. means Father. Robert is a Catholic priest. What does a Catholic priest really know about sex? Well, at least we know that he does have some 1st hand experience. You see, Fr. Francouer is a married Catholic priest. 

This is a really great couple of conversations. I hope you enjoy.  Oh, I'm not 100% sure when we aired these, but 2001 is a good guess. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Spiritual Brilliance of Thomas Merton Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[These episodes, from 2008, are conversations with Morgan Atkinson. He wrote the book & TV special "Soul Searching," an in-depth discovery of Thomas Merton and his pioneering spiritual work. 

Sometimes for the heck of it, I tune into EWTN, the hardcore conservative Catholic radio network. Recently on a call-in show someone asked a priest about Fr. Merton. One might guess that his take on Merton was less than favorable. While he is often regarded as a "patron saint" of the Catholic contemplative movement, there are many in the Church who would wish him to be excommunicated posthumously. But as you'll hear here, this was a  flawed, but deeply spiritual giant.  Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Holy Vote: Politics in America Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Ray Suarez is one of my most favorite guests. I've been a major fan since he hosted "Talk of the Nation" on NPR back in the 90s. Is this interview dated? In a way, yes, because it was recorded in 2006. But how prescient it is. When it was broadcast GW Bush was in the White House. We did have to deal with the absurd religiosity that prompted him to make the decisions he did. But now we are still in the throes of some of the most dangerous theocratic movements we'll ever see in the post-Trump era. 

I often enjoy reading or listening to accounts of the past just to see how right or wrong the authors were in their assessments of situations. This is an excellent example. Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[These episodes are from 2008. Here I interview Dr. Rodney Stark from Baylor University.  Interesting chap. One gets the impression that he doesn't suffer fools gladly...or easily. How much you wanna bet that his students call him Dr. Snark? Anyway, I did think he was quite engaging. A bit biased toward Christianity, but still, I enjoyed my time with him. We discuss his book "Discovering God." Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Grand Dialogue: Science &amp; Religion Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Holy Moses! I had thought that I'd digitized all the cassette tapes of old Common Threads programs a few months ago. Now, I discover a whole shoe box filled to the brim with more. Now we start the process all over again. 

This little gem comes from 2007. IDA had partnered with a new org here in Grand Rapids called Grand Dialogue. Their mission is focused on the intersection of faith & science. Now both GD & IDA are affiliate orgs under the umbrella of Kaufman Interfaith Institute.  These episodes are conversations with that year's keynote speaker. Philip Clayton, a professor with ties to Harvard, Cambridge and Claremont. His talk is on "Emergence."

I hope I don't have to tell you to ignore any mentions of the conference itself, which happened over a decade ago. But the discussion is still worthwhile.

 Theme music "Nigal."

While I'd love to tell you that  these episodes feature The Man himself, I am pleased to  offer you a wonderful conversation with someone he mentored for decades. Rev. Michael Battles has patterned his life after this living saint.  He is the author of a deeply moving spiritual biography of Bishop Tutu. Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Speak of the Devil: How The Satanic Temple is Changing the Way We Talk about Religion Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In all of the years of Common Threads it seems like we have never really given The Devil his due. I mean, where would religion be without him? Our interview here in these 2021 episodes try to accomplish 2 things: We want to get a better understanding of the various  versions of Satan/Lucifer that are exposed in the Bible. And then there is the rise of "devil worship" in modern American.  Keep in mind that those who supposedly worship Satan don't really believe in him, but enjoy the furrowed brows of those religionists who do. 

This is really an excellent conversation. Join us. Theme music "Nigal."

Keep in mind that those who supposedly worship Satan don&apos;t really believe in him, but enjoy the furrowed brows of those religionists who do.

      <itunes:subtitle>In all of the years of Common Threads it seems like we have never really given The Devil his due. I mean, where would religion be without him? Our interview here in these 2021 episodes try to accomplish 2 things: We want to get a better understanding of the various  versions of Satan/Lucifer that are exposed in the Bible. And then there is the rise of &quot;devil worship&quot; in modern American.

      <title>Treating  Emotional &amp; Psychological Issues in the Hindu Community Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I've known Kavita Pallod Sekhsaria for several years now. As long as I've known her she was working toward her PhD in Psychology, with the goal of focusing her efforts on offering treatment to those in her own spiritual community. 

One thing we can be proud of here in the west is that we have come such a long way over the years in allowing those who suffer from depression and other mental  challenges to live with much less of a stigma than before. We're not perfect, but better. Well, the same cannot be said for Asian communities.  One of Kavita's goals is to reverse that. 

Aired in 2021.

Impressive ambition. Listen. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Spiritual Audacity of Abraham Joshua Heschel Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[One of the things I love to do from time to time is take advantage of the opportunity to promote some of the great programming that we air on our sister station WGVU-TV, our areas PBS affiliate.  In May of 2021 PBS stations across the country aired a remarkable documentary on the life of Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, one of the most influential clergymen and academics of the 20th century.  If you'd not heard of him, or know little of his story, do give this a listen. And look for showings of the documentary in your area.


Our guest is Martin Doblmeier,  the founder of Journey Films Inc, a film and television production company focused creating content on religion, faith and spirituality. Martin holds degrees in Religious Studies, Broadcast Journalism and honorary degrees in Fine Arts and Humane Letters. Since 1984 he has produced and directed more than 30 films focused on religion, faith and spirituality.  His films include Bonhoffer (2003) The Power of Forgiveness (2007), An American Conscience: The Reinhold Niebuhr Story (2017), and Backs Against The Wall: The Howard Thurman Story (2019).

      <title>The Bible With &amp; Without Jesus Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Not long ago I was speaking to a friend about how Jews interpret the Bible. He couldn't see how the writings of the prophets such as Isaiah or Ezekiel could be talking about anything other than predicting the coming of Jesus as Messiah. This is remarkably provincial thinking--especially coming from a graduate of Yale who majored in philosophy! But he was never exposed to any other theological option.

Yes, Virginia, there are other ways to understand that the Hebrew Bible can stand on its own as scripture. This is not to diminish the fact that over a billion people do see it as a collection of accounts that do indeed foretell the advent of Jesus. 

That is why I so enjoyed the book we are discussing in these 2021 episodes with Amy-Jill Levine. I've respected her work for long time. I've seen her speak & heard multiple recorded lectures by her.  She is a Jew who is quite capable of understanding the wisdom of both traditions.

Amy-Jill Levine is  Professor of New Testament and Jewish Studies,  at Vanderbilt Divinity School, Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Sociology of Religion Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[While I enjoy discussing the Big Questions of theology, eschatology, etc., there is also the appeal of just how religion shapes societies & individuals. That would be sociology. I came across our guest for these 2021 episodes in a manner similar to other bookings--by accident. I was surfing the web for something else and landed on the site for the Society of the Scientific Study of Religion. 

OK, I'll speak out of school a bit here. Laura was not my 1st choice for whom to interview from that org. Before connecting with her I tried in vain to wrangle one of her colleagues to do this. The reason being is that aside from his role in SSSR he taught at a local college. It's always great to have people join us in-studio. But he didn't think our audience would really appreciate hearing about their work, as it is "scientific" not "spiritual." 

I say we prove him wrong. Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

We share the concerns of an unbridled form of capitalism, misguided religious fervor, corrupt elected officials and work force that is under the yoke of all the above.  They were dark days.

      <title>In Sync With the Sacred, Out of Step With the World Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[If you've listened to a good chunk of our collection here of episodes that date back a couple of decades you may have come across a few that I've recorded with my cousin. Fr. Tom Stella was ordained at Notre Dame in the early 70s. He currently is a chaplain at a healthcare organization that is co-operated by both the Catholic Church and the 7th Day Adventists in Colorado.

We aired this episode in early 2021 about his 5th book. What I really enjoy about this work is that he goes into lengths to expose his shadow side. His commitment to honesty is quite impressive. 

Hey, 2 Stellas for the price of one? Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[These episodes aired shortly after the insurrection at the Capitol (or as some Republicans called it, "Just a regular bunch of patriotic tourists visiting'). Remember the QAnon Shaman? Many thought he might be a part of a white supremacy movement that refers to itself as Heathenism. Actually, he has no part in that, but to the uninitiated he seemed to look the part. Join us for Jennifer Snook's take on this movement here in the US. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>A justification for unrest? Look no further than the Bible and the Founding Fathers Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A question that is often asked as a thought experiment concerns the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter. Is there one? Well, if you are looking to either the Bible or our Founders I'm not sure you'd walk away with an easy answer. So in these 2 episodes from early 2021 we discuss with Sam Boyd his article that explores this issue.

Samuel L. Boyd is an Assistant Professor in Religious Studies and the Program in Jewish Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder. His research focuses on the origins of biblical texts in their historical context, as well as how people have interpreted the Bible over the millennia. He combines history, archaeology, linguistics, and multiple other theoretical lenses to explore why the Bible was written and why people have cared about it so much. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Crown, The Anglican Church &amp; More Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[It seems like I must be a mutant American, as I have such little interest in the British monarchy. I always seemed to know just as much as a tabloid cover in a check-out stand would tell me. So I came to The Crown with a bit of an attitude. But my wife knows good TV, and she did persuade me. And yes, I got hooked. Love it. Cant' wait for the next season. 

I did notice how religion has a rather significant role to play in the show. As you might know, the reining monarch is the titular head of the Anglican Church.  Well, Fr. Christian Brocato is a local friend here in Grand Rapids who pastors an Episcopal (a denomination within the Anglican Communion)  church. When I found out he was a fan as well I thought he'd be a great fit for a couple of episodes to discuss this. From 2020. Theme music "Nigal."

The publisher told him to replace the word "Hindu" with "Indian." Alok said no, & then self published.  He is quite firm in his belief that it was just Indian culture that encouraged significant discoveries, but the religion of that culture.  Curious? Listen. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Spritual Practices for crazy times Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>When we produced these episodes in 2020 we were in serious doo-doo. Trump was still n the White House and Covid was at its peak.

      <title>London Street: A Memoir Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Growing up in Detroit, I had no exposure to the Dutch Reformed traditions. It wasn't until I moved to Grand Rapids that I learned what an influential subculture they represent. Speaking to friends who grew up in the various Reformed denominations I heard both horror stories of strict upbringings that included no secular movies or having to refrain from swimming on  90 degree Sundays, as well as accounts of profound spiritual commitment by those who embraced  the theology as well as its austere guidelines of behavior.

In the book "London Street" the author Jane Griffioen shares her experiences from childhood through adulthood in this atmosphere. It is a warm, yet not uncritical remembrance. Honestly, I when approached to have this conversation I was concerned that the book might be an angst driven screed against the faith of her fathers (and mothers). It is not, but it is honest. 

Listen. Love it.  From 2020. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Taking America Back for God Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Clemson Sociology professor Andrew Whitehead discusses how Christian nationalism drives American politics in these 2020 episodes.   Andrew has co-authored the book, ‘Taking America Back for God.’

Andrew Whitehead is an Associate Professor of Sociology at Clemson University. He is interested in how religion both shapes and is shaped by the surrounding culture and how this influences various social institutions, such as the family. Andrew is the author of over 30 peer-reviewed publications. Recently, his research on Christian nationalism and childhood disability and religion has been featured across a number of national outlets including the Washington Post, CNN Today, and The Huffington Post, among others. Andrew’s first book on Christian nationalism, with Sam Perry, is called ‘Taking America Back for God.’ It provides the first comprehensive empirical analysis of Christian nationalism in the United States.

      <title>‘White Christian Privilege: The Illusion of Religious Equality in America Parts 1 &amp;2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Khyati Y. Joshi joins us for conversation on her new book, ‘White Christian Privilege: The Illusion of Religious Equality in America.’

Khyati Y. Joshi is a Professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University and author of ‘New Roots in America’s Sacred Ground: Religion, Race, and Ethnicity in Indian America,’ and co-editor of ‘Teaching for Diversity and Social Justice.’

In ‘White Christian Privilege,’ Joshi traces Christianity’s influence on the American experiment from before the founding of the Republic to the social movements of today. Mapping the way through centuries of slavery, westward expansion, immigration, and citizenship laws, she also reveals the ways Christian privilege in the United States has always been entangled with notions of White supremacy.

      <description><![CDATA[Evangelical culture has in recent decades taken up the cause of maintaining the virginity of teenagers come hell or high water.  How many of you can guess that the results have been, well, mixed. Like everything else, it's complicated. Oy, is it complicated. These episodes originally aired in 2019. It is important to note that our guest was accused of sexual misbehavior with a member of a church youth group in the previous year. We, of course, had no idea of this. Our exploration of this issue indicates that the allegations are credible.  We regret that we had no knowledge of this before inviting him to join us. 

But this does not in any way diminish the validity of what he says. As a matter of fact, it almost seems to verify the danger of purity culture. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Ethnic Cleansing in Kashmir Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For more than a half century the Indian state of Kashmir held a special status that allowed it to be semi-autonomous. This allowed, among other things, for it to be governed by sharia law. In 2019 the government ceased that, allowing Jammu & Kashmir to become wholly administered by Delhi. 

Most news reports were about serious allegations of human rights abuses that took place in order to bring this change about. But missing from many conversations was the subject of the jihadist  rebellion of the early 90s that chased Hindus from the area. Many died, and many more became displaced in their own country. These episodes include conversations with one who lived through it all. Chilling. But join us.

Sidarth Ambardar joins us to discuss  the Partition of India and Pakistan, its history from the tribal invasion of Kashmir to the present as recounted in ‘Days of Destiny: A Memoir of Kashmir’ a book written by his father, Shanti Swarup Ambardar.  Theme music "Nigal."

      <itunes:subtitle>For more than a half century the Indian state of Kashmir held a special status that allowed it to be semi-autonomous. This allowed, among other things, for it to be governed by sharia law. In 2019 the government ceased that, allowing Jammu &amp; Kashmir to become wholly administered by Delhi. 

Most news reports were about serious allegations of human rights abuses that took place in order to bring this change about. But missing from many conversations was the subject of the jihadist  rebellion of the early 90s that chased Hindus from the area. Many died, and many more became displaced in their own country. These episodes include conversations with one who lived through it all. Chilling. But join us.

      <title>Archeology In the Hands of the Crazies Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[It never occurred to me that Archeology could be a lot like radio. That is, a lot of people think that all they need is a microphone in front of them & they'd be brilliant. 

More often than not....not. 

Over the decades it seems that a lot of people have thought that to be an archeologist all they needed was a shovel.  In these episodes from '19 we talk with Prof. Mark Schwartz about people who thought the were making big discoveries (often in fields related to religion) that in reality were pretty fraudulent. Trust me, this is entertainment of a high order.

Mark received his PhD in Anthropology from Northwestern University. His research focused on trade between the early city-states of Mesopotamia and the emerging complex societies of Anatolia in the fourth millennium B.C.  He has worked on various excavations in the Middle East. He is currently involved in inter-departmental collaborative work using ROVs to study shipwrecks in the Great Lakes. He teaches courses on the archaeology of the Near East as well as general courses concerning anthropology and archaeology. Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[OK, so we all know we need to have a little patience with those in our midst who are newly in love. They may get dewy eyed, drone on a bit long about their newfound happiness, and refer to this Gift from Heaven as their soulmate. So we must ask, is there such a thing? If so, why do so many "soulmates" part in anger years (or months...or weeks) later? Well, here are 2 episodes that explore the notion.

Our guest is Bradley Onishi, Associate Professor of Religious Studies at Skidmore College.  Dr. Onishi joins us to discuss his article ‘What’s Behind the Belief in a Soulmate’ on the website The Conversation.

      <title>Religious Freedom &amp; The Constitution Parts 1 &amp;2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[We've broached this subject before. But I really think these episodes are so spot on; especially as the right-wing of the spectrum is using this subject to weaponize religion. 

Lawrence G. Sager joins us to talk  about the book he co-authored with Christopher L. Eisgruber in 2007 titled, ‘Religious Freedom and the Constitution.’ This aired in 2019.

Lawrence Sager is one of the nation's preeminent constitutional theorists and scholars. Professor Sager currently teaches as the University of Texas. He previously taught at New York University School of Law, where he was Co-Founder of the Program in Law, Philosophy & Social Theory. He has also taught at Harvard, Princeton, Boston University, UCLA, and the University of Michigan. Sager is also the author of ‘Justice in Plainclothes: a Theory of American Constitutional Practice.’ Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The challenge with taking a critical look at the Bible is that people tend to treat it as just one book, as opposed to thinking of it as a library, which is certainly closer to the mark. Yes, there are those who give  the accounts of both Adam and David the same credibility. But those people are usually not archeologists, and credentialed historians. </p><p>Then, of course, you have your knee-jerk skeptics who say that everything in the scriptures is pure mythology.  Thankfully, there is a middle path that encourages each account to be taken at its own value.  In these 2019 episodes we bring back a dear friend to the show. Sheldon Kopprel  is one of those amazing people who is able to percolate from both sides of the brain. Dr. Kopprel is a  now  a retired professor of Science (he was still working when this aired), as well as a very well studied scholar of Jewish theology. His days often began by rising at 4am to  delve into the depths of the Bible and Talmud. </p><p> </p>

      <title>Tales of the Celtic Goddesses Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I find it fascinating how so many of the old, diminished traditions around the world are being revisited by people in the 21st century.  We see this with those exploring the ancient mythologies of Egypt, Rome, Greece, Scandinavia, Central America, and of course, Celtic culture. These are delightful episodes that feature conversations with Anne Cates Sullivan, who authored 2 award winning books on the goddess tradition of Ireland.

      <description><![CDATA[Of all the theories of afterlife that permeate the various world religions, the concept of rebirth is the only one that has actually been studied by science. Many are amazed by the fact that the University of Virginia has an entire department dedicated to such research. And this effort isn't found in the halls of Philosophy, Religious Studies or some course on alternative spiritual practices. This all happens within the labs of UV's medical school.

      <description><![CDATA[Of all the diverse expressions of Christianity here in the USA, Eastern Orthodoxy gets much less attention than it gets. After centuries of being identified with specific cultures and languages, Christians from multitudinous backgrounds are signing up, seeing what they claim to be an authenticity that they don't see in the denominations of their birth. It has been years since we've given air time  to these folks. Our guest, Fr. Michael Nasser from here in Grand Rapids, MI explains it all (OK, maybe not ALL..but enough) for you. Theme music "Nigal."

Keele Burgin provides us with a heart rending account of her childhood spent in a family mesmerized by the promises of rewards for living a &quot;fully Catholic&quot; life in these 2019 episodes.</itunes:subtitle>

      <title>Persecuted Muslims in a Muslim Land: The Ahmadhiyya</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The problem with theocracies is that it's much easier to be branded a heretic or a blasphemer, which can be illegal. The Ahmadhiyya sect of Islam is branded just that in Pakistan; which is, for all intents and purposes, a Muslim theocracy. It's one of 2 countries that have large numbers of members. The other one is neighboring India. One might assume that it's easier for a Muslim to be a Muslim in a Muslim nation, more so than in a majority Hindu nation. Not so. India has an ethos of pluralism that accepts theological diversity much easier than Pakistan.

In these episodes from 2019, I speak with Fazeel Khan, an Ahmadhiyya Muslim from Pakistan, who offers us a history of his particular movement, and the trials that a lack of religious freedom bring. 

A footnote to this: Fazeel & I became fast friends. In the summer of that year he invited me to address a world convocation of Ahmaddhiyya Muslims in Columbus, Ohio. It was a rare privilege, for which I am quite grateful. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Roman Catholic Women Priests: Valid but Illicit Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[At the 2019 Parliament of World Religions  I met a group of women at a booth that claimed they were fully ordained Roman Catholic priests. Needless to say, I was taken aback, and quickly  questioned them, as I'm sure so many people do on a regular basis. How in the world can women be Catholic priests? The Church has made it abundantly clear that female clerics would be as impossible as men giving birth.

So, how can this happen officially? Well, I ask you to listen to their story, offered by Mary Eileen Collingwood; and find out how Church law can deem an act "valid but illicit." Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>John Fetzer: A Powerfully Lived Life in the Spirit Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Here in West Michigan the name Fetzer is well known. The Kalamazoo area businessman owned a broadcast complex of WKZO-AM/FM/TV. Little did the community know that this nominal Presbyterian was engaged in a spiritual search that was much more inclusive and, well, cosmic, than his peers. Very few were allowed to observe this side of him. But he left a profound legacy in both the Fetzer Institute & Foundation. One organization focuses on interfaith engagement, the other on deep spirituality that often crosses the boundaries of most organized religions.

In these 2018 episodes we speak with Brian Wilson (no, not that Brian Wilson, but if you know the other, tell him he's welcome on our show too!) who authored the book "John E Fetzer & the Quest for the New Age."

Enjoy Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[These were wonderful conversations with Mirabai Starr. Those of us of a certain age will most likely have a fond place in our hearts for Ram Dass of "Be Here Now" fame. For the past several years he has lived joyfully with the aftereffects of a stroke. Before he died, he allowed his journey to be chronicled, and used as an example to aspiring yogis. His good friend, Mirabai helped him walk that journey. In these episodes from 2018 she shares her very powerful experiences with her friend and teacher. Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[Yes, it may be dated, but it's often interesting to go back in time to find out where & what we were at any given moment. When this aired we were waiting with bated breath to find out if there was going to be the predicted Blue Wave. And if that was to be, what, if any, role would America's religious values of both the Left & Right have to do with it?

We were blessed with that wonderful wave. It did a soul good to see it.  In these episodes we talk with Mark Silk, a great observer of religion in the public square. So let's hearken back to those days of anticipation, as we begin to see the slow demise of The Donald. Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[Shuji Mintzmeyer is one of the leading voices in contemporary Buddhism in Michigan. One of the things I do is coordinate speakers from different religions for schools, colleges, churches, etc. Whenever I book Shuji for anything, I am confident that the audience is not only going to learn about the Dharma, but they are going to receive their information from someone who has achieved a high level of realization herself.

      <title>The Religious Liberty Task Force: Much Ado About Nothing Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Former AG Jeff Sessions did a great deal of damage to this nation before he was unceremoniously booted by Trump out of his office. Interestingly, his demise was an example of a rare showing of nobility, as he recused himself from the Russia investigation.

One of the things he did that encouraged the kind of divisiveness his boss loved was establishing the Religious Liberty Task Force. Of course he would promote the false narrative that Christians are an oppressed group in the USA.  I'm sure that had he been given more time in office, he would have established a task force to help protect us from atheist robots. 
In these 2018 episodes we chat with Rachel Laser from Americans United for the Separation of Church & State.  She is brilliant. Listen. 
No. Really. Listen! Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>What&apos;s Behind America&apos;s Promotion of Religious Liberty Abroad Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[As with many other terms, the political/religious right has co-opted "religious liberty." For many in the center & left it referred to the tolerance & acceptance of those who practice a minority faith to be able to do so without fear of harassment.While it can still mean that, more often than not the people who use the phrase are speaking of something different. Our guest in these 2018 episodes provides excellent food for thought on this subject.

      <title>The Monk&apos;s Record Player: Thomas Merton &amp; Bob Dylan Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[There are 2 icons of the 60s who spoke to, for the most part, different audiences. Fr. Thomas Merton was a legendary Catholic monk who inspired thousands of Christians to adapt a more contemplative life, & acknowledged that much can be gained & shared by dialoging with Eastern traditions.

And Bob Dylan was....well, Bob friggin' Dylan. I don't need to say much more.  What is interesting to note is how much the music of the former Zimmerman inspired the Trappist monk.  While Dylan has been for most of his adult life rather secular (with just a brief spell as an Evangelical Christian), to those who see Spirit in the most unlikely places, it's not hard to understand the attraction. 

These episodes feature a chat with Robert Hudson, who authored the book "The Monk's Record Player." 
These are great conversations. Listen. Enjoy. Repeat.

      <title>The Life of Yogananda Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In the 20th century a good number of Hindu teachers emigrated to the US. One of the most influential was the man known as Paramhansa Yogananda (1893-1952). He began a small school in India that grew into a worldwide mission that focused on instructing people of all or no religions on the deeper practices, philosophy & theology of Raja Yoga.  His 1946 book "Autobiography of a Yogi" is still a spiritual bestseller today. 

Phil Goldberg is a leading author on Hinduism in the West. He's also someone I love hanging with every time I'm in LA. His book on Yogananda is well researched, & a compelling story. It is neither hagiographic nor a sensational hit piece. If you enjoy Eastern thought, you'll appreciate these 2018 episodes Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>‘Building a Bridge: How the Catholic Church and the LGBT Community Can Enter into a Relationship of Respect, Compassion, and Sensitivity.’</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Fr. James Martin has a reputation of being a very inclusive thinker in Catholic circles. So much so that he occasionally get in trouble Case in point: In this 2018 interview he details the slings & arrows he endured for writing a book that encouraged a conversation within the Church about LGBT issues. Notice I said "conversation." The book does not call for rewriting dogma, blind acceptance of what is the current social norm, or violent revolution in the streets. Just a conversation. 

Believe me, he could write a new book just relating his experiences in writing this one.

Good conversation is just click a way. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Remember Roy Moore? That Kinda Creepy Guy Revisited Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I know that one could dismiss these episodes as being rather dated. The originally aired in January of 2018,  shortly after the special election in Alabama that made Roy Moore somewhat redundant. But the problems surrounding him were and are systemic  in Evangelical circles. Remember, it was his lusty appetite for teenage girls that cost him the election. 

Joining me here is Kathryn Brightbill, a writer who examined Moore's behavior in context with his religious culture.

 Family Values, anyone?

      <description><![CDATA[This is an amazing story, seriously. My good friend Rabbi David Krishef gets a letter that is just one long anti-Jewish screed from a Christian man that so many others would have just thrown away without finishing. But David took this opportunity to reach out to this guy, & invited him to have a conversation. Keep listening & you'll hear about how the 2 of them ended up in Israel together (on this crazy guy's dime!) It's one of my favorites from 2017. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Lived Hinduism: Religion Beyond Academics Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[One of the major beefs (OK, not the best word in this context here) that so many Hindu friends have with academia is that when they study Hinduism in high school & college they don't really recognize the religion they've been practicing all their lives. This is often due to the colonial mindset that many researchers hold. In these 2 episodes I speak to a couple of brilliant academicians who have attempted to present Hinduism in book that features multiple points of view, but focus not on the lore of old, but as it is lived in modern times. This is from 2017.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Shortly after the march in Charlottesville, where "fine people on both sides" (yeah, right) met to protest with tiki torches (2017) I decided to call up my old friend Shel Kopperl.  Naturally, with Trump in the White House this was going to be a challenging 4 years for  American Jews, excepting those who will forgive anything in turn for an uber-hawkish stand on Israel. </p><p>But those on the hard Left are not blameless.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shortly after the march in Charlottesville, where "fine people on both sides" (yeah, right) met to protest with tiki torches (2017) I decided to call up my old friend Shel Kopperl.  Naturally, with Trump in the White House this was going to be a challenging 4 years for  American Jews, excepting those who will forgive anything in turn for an uber-hawkish stand on Israel. </p><p>But those on the hard Left are not blameless. In these 2 episodes we do our best to sort things out in this quagmire.</p>

      <title>Stop Me if You&apos;ve Heard this One: Converting for Jewish Humor Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>There's a great Seinfeld episode where a friend of Jerry's decided to convert to Judaism strictly for the humor.  I totally get that. I'm not Jewish, but I have had a fascination with the brilliance of their wit since I was a kid watching stand-up comedians on Ed Sullivan.  You'll hear me say in Episode #1 how Jewish humor appreciation was a must have if a relationship with a woman was to go anywhere. That's not hyberbole.</p><p>So when I found out that Ruth Wisse had written a book called "NO Joke: Making Jewish Humor," I had to track her down and get her on Common Threads.  I did. Now enjoy.</p>

      <title>So a Muslim and an Evangelical Christian Walk Into a Bar....</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Well, a bar is not a place you'd really find a Muslim or an Evangelical (well, depending on the stripe, I guess) , but from what we often see in the media, you wouldn't find Muslims and conservative Christians walk into just about ANY place together. OK, maybe a courtroom to fight about the construction of a mosque in a rural community. But our guest today talks about the most ambitious interactions between those 2 faiths that I've ever heard. Bob Roberts of the Emir-Stien Center discusses his most impressive work with people all over the world--including Muslims. This show also came about due to the same Evangelical conference at Calvin Seminary in Grand Rapids, MI that gave us the previous episode, featuring John Morehead, in 2017. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Evangelicals &amp; Interfaith: Strange Bedfellows?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Back in 2017 I was made aware that Calvin College's seminary was hosting an event that focused on interfaith/multi-faith engagement that had no hidden agenda of conversion attempts. Needless to say, this intrigued me. It happened that I had to attend a funeral on this particular day; otherwise, I'm sure I would have been there. Fortunately, I was able to make a connection with 2 of the presenters. One of them was John Morehouse. This was a great conversation.

John Morehead is our guest.  John is the Director of the Foundation for Religious Diplomacy and the Western Institute for Intercultural Studies.  John is co-editor and contributing author for ‘Encountering New Religious Movements’ and editor of ‘Beyond the Burning Times a Pagan and Christian in Dialogue.’ Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>&apos;POTUS Shield: Trump’s Dominionist Prayer Warriors and the ‘Prophetic Order of the United States.&apos;</title>
      <description><![CDATA[We did it! As I write this in November of 2020 the country is glowing in anticipation of a new administration that will, we hope, undo much of the dismantling of our country's foundations that happened under Trump. During these last 4 years I will admit to doing whatever I could to shed light on the underbelly (did it even have an overbelly?) of his swamp-filling efforts.  Here is one example that aired within his 1st year in the White House.

OK, perhaps we can't take ALL the credit for his defeat, but let us live with the illusion that we helped.

With that, do give one a listen. I realize that with Trump out of office we need not dwell on him as much as we have. But make no mistake. He will still try to wreak the divisive havoc on our nation as he has since the Obama years.  It's good to remind ourselves what could have happened should he have won another 4 years. 

Scary to even think about. Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Whispering Words of Wisdom: The Spirituality of The Beatles Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Do you want to know a secret? Inside this rather centered post-middle-aged theologically minded radio host is a 14-year old girl who hasn't stopped screaming since she saw the Fab 4 on Ed Sullivan in 1964. To say I was & am a Beatles Fan borders on severe understatement.  So to have chance to converse with someone who is not only like minded, but has the academic cred to (hobnail) boot was not something to pass on. So in 2017 I enjoyed to the hilt these discussions with Kenneth Womack. 

His  Beatles-related books include  Long and Winding Roads: The Evolving Artistry of the Beatles (2007) and The Cambridge Companion to the Beatles (2009), which was named as The Independent’s “Music Book of the Year.” In 2014, Ken published The Beatles Encyclopedia: Everything Fab Four. Ken’s books about the Beatles are included in the permanent collection of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s Library and Archives.

Ken is Dean of the Wayne D. McMurray School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Monmouth University, where he also serves as Professor of English. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Thich Nhat Hahn and the Art of Living Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Even people who know little about Buddhism can often identify both the Dalai Lama & Thich Naht Hahn as major thought leaders today. Back in 2017 I was alerted that the latter had just published a book entitled The Art of Living. Excited at the chance to have such an august personage on the program, I contacted the people who make this sort of thing happen. Well, it turns out that Thich Naht Hahn was not doing interviews at the time. However, I was directed to 2 of his most highly advanced disciples who were willing to join me. So in the 1st week I was able to discuss the the book with Brother Phap. Then the following week I spoke to Sister Dedication. I enjoyed our conversations immensely.

      <description><![CDATA[When we think of Hippies the 1st things that pop into many minds are drugs, music, hedonism, promiscuity, political activism & a disdain for hard work. These stereotypes are grounded in truth, but not the whole truth. There was also a deep spiritual search going on, sometimes in concert with the aforementioned proclivities. This 2017 conversation in 2 parts with author Dan Goldberg examines these various elements that made 1967 a year for the books. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Irony Repeats Itself: Reconsidering Reinhold Niebuhr in the Trump Era Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The year is 2017, and many of us are still reeling at the thought of having Trump in the office he's in. Over the past 4 years (I'm writing this just after the '20 election, Yay!) I've made no bones about the fact that I believe this presidency has done great harm to this country.  So here, Rev. Gary Dorrien joins us for a conversation on his Religion Dispatches article, “Irony Repeats Itself: Reconsidering Reinhold Niebuhr in the Trump Era.”

Rev. Dorrien is an American social ethicist and theologian. He is the Reinhold Niebuhr Professor of Social Ethics at Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York and Professor of Religion at Columbia University.  He is the author of 18 books on ethics, social theory, philosophy, theology, politics, and intellectual history.

Prior to joining the faculty at Union and Columbia in 2005, Dorrien taught at Kalamazoo College, where he served as Parfet Distinguished Professor and as Dean of Stetson Chapel. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Progressive Muslims: Yes! They&apos;re a Thing. Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Once again, one of the awesome people I met at the Council on Foreign Relations in NYC. These conversations with Ani Zonneveld took place in 2017.

What I noticed at the CFR conference is that there was a significant tension between Ani, the Director of Muslims for Progressive Values and those more traditional, orthodox Muslims. Ani is very impatient with what are often termed "moderate Muslims." It's not that she thinks they are extremists in disguise. Rather, she is concerned that while they do speak out against Islamist terrorist attacks, they remain silent on issues of gender, sexual orientation, religious tolerance, etc. 

She is frustrated that her non-Muslim  counterparts left of center do things like wear hijabs in support of the women of Islam, when she as a Muslim finds such traditions medieval and useless. Really, these 2 episodes offer a great deal to think about. Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>May Cause Love: A Multi-Faith Approach to Healing From Abortion Without Judgement</title>
      <description><![CDATA[There is no one way that women react after having an abortion. Some can move on with their lives almost immediately.  Some may regret their decision. Yet others acknowledge a psychic and emotional pain that requires a healing, though they do not regret their choice. 
Kassi Underwood falls into that 3rd category. She uses that pain to investigate the healing rituals and practices of various religions. It is through this work and the book (May Cause Love) that she is brought to wholeness. 
These episodes that aired in 2017 contain some of the most intimate conversations that have taken place on CT.  I really think you'll like this. Enjoy.

      <title>Rethinking The Catholic Tradition Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[One of the great things about hosting CT is that I get to invite some of my more enlightened friends into the studio to have conversations like we would anyway. But I love sharing their wisdom.  Well, here is a perfect example.

A good way to describe Fr. Joachim Lally would be to mention that when my father-in-law died, my wife & her 3 siblings (all ex-Catholics) looked to me to find a priest to say the funeral Mass for this very devout Catholic parent of theirs. But they didn't  want what they experienced when they buried their equally devout mother with a rather traditional priest presiding. 

Fr. Lally immediately agreed, and I was king for a day when it was all over. 
We aired these episodes in 2016, shortly before he was scheduled to lead a meditation course at a Hindu ashram in the Bahamas. At the time Fr. Lally knew next to nothing about Hinduism or what to expect. He didn't seek this job out. I should have had him back to describe his experience afterward. Oh well.

Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Onieda: From Free Love Utopia to the Well Set Table</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Please don't tell me you just saw the term "Free Love Utopia" & were hoping they were taking applications. Sorry to disappoint if you did. But these are really excellent conversations. The Oneida  community is a true slice of religious Americana. What a fascinating history of folks who just thought they were doing all the right things. All this & some very stylish & sturdy dinner flatware.

I grew up in a family company that focused on restaurant design & supplies. How many times did I fill orders for Oneida forks, spoons & knives with not the slightest idea of the great stale behind it all. 

Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>My God, I&apos;ve Wasted My Life: A Conversation With Larry Brilliant  Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I know, that's a weird title for a program. But believe me, many of the guests I've hosted on Common Threads have me saying that to myself. Some of these folks have contributed SO much to the world community. 

And then there's me... Yeah, not so much.

Larry Brilliant is one such person who seems to have lived about 14 lives in one incarnation.  Larry Brilliant is a pioneering physician, visionary technologist,  and a global philanthropist.  From 1973 to 1976, he participated in the successful World Health Organization smallpox eradication program. Larry currently serves as the chairman of Skoll Global Threats Fund.  

It sounds cliche, but he's a former member of the flower power generation who went to India. He found a guru. But this guru didn't advise him to meditate in a cave the rest of his life. He charged him to help eradicate one of the most pernicious diseases of the 20th century. 

And that he did. And that's just one chapter. Listen on....

And enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Metropolitan Church: The Story of Transformation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Many years ago I interviewed a local minister for the Metropolitan Church here in Grand Rapids. The denomination was formed specifically to focus on the needs of gay Christians. In its early days, the church the same very fundamentalist theology that most of the congregations who expelled their gay members did.  Over the years they have embraced a more progressive spiritual world view.
I don't have a copy of that original program from way back when. But one day while we were staying in our Florida condo for a few days, my wife tells me that she met our neighbors in the complex; 2 women, one of whom was the denominational head of Metropolitan. Well, we got to know them both quite well over the years, and when we do go down we always try to arrange a dinner out to catch up. Nancy Wilson is a remarkable spiritual leader. I hope you give this a listen. Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[If you've listened to Common Threads enough you know that we like to dive into "deep dialogue." What that means is that we aren't afraid to tackle issues that might ruffle feathers from time to time. Not all positions labeled "religious" are honorable or uplift the human spirit. 

Well, here are 2 episodes that make that deep dive. It's really one of my favorites from 2016.  Richard Benkin, our guest, is a compelling speaker who balances a variety approaches with  serious pragmatism.

The topic was bringing religion into the public square, and how to navigate the appropriate protocol and respect for pluralism. These episodes preceded the event, serving as a bit of a sneak preview.</itunes:subtitle>

      <title>Hare Krishna at 50 Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[If you grew up in any major metropolitan area in North America or Europe in the late 60s/early 70s it's quite likely that you encountered a group of younger folk in the garb of Gaudiya Vaishnavs chants & dancing in public areas. They became known as the Hare Krishnas, due to the mantra they chanted. 
They went from being suspected as a cult to now being a fairly respected branch of Hindu thought and practice in both religious and academic circles. In 2015-16 celebrations around the USA abounded, as devotees observed the 50th anniversary of their guru establishing his work in this country. 
Here are my conversations with Anuttama Data, one of the original teachers of the tradition. 
Hare Krishna, Y'all! Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Spiritual Adventures of a Religious Rebel--Richard Rhem Up Close Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[If you are not from West Michigan these episodes might not mean as much, but I think they tell a good story. Rev. Richard Rhem was ordained in the Reformed Protestant tradition, & was quite conservative. 
Spring Lake is a  lovely community quite close to Lake Michigan. This is where he served when he led the congregation at Christ Community Church. 

Over the years his faith expanded in a direction completely unpredicted. As his theology became more & more progressive his denomination became more & more concerned.  Finally, his congregation separated from the Reformed Church of America & became an independent liberal church.

I'm so glad we had the opportunity to have these conversations in 2016. After suffering health issues for quite a while Dick passed away in early 2020.

His story is just a click away. Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>A Look Back at Where We Were Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[One of the great things about having a talk show is being able to invite interesting friends on. You can just have a conversation similar to what you might have in "real life" with people listening in. 

I mentioned in the summary of a recent episode that a conference at the Council on Foreign Relations ended up inspiring several shows.  This is one. My guest didn't attend that, but I appreciated his insights on the subjects that were covered over the 2 days of the gathering in NYC.

Charley Honey was an editor/columnist for the Grand Rapids Press Religion section for many years. He is a man of keen intellect & deep spirituality. When I invited him on back in 2016 the nation was very tense. We were looking down the barrel of 4 years of a Trump presidency.  We were still confident that it wouldn't happen, but the moral fissures of the country were made very apparent.  We spoke of other things as well. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Interfaith Internships &amp; Why We Do Them  Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[We don't do many programs on our organization (Interfaith Dialogue Association, an affiliate of Kaufman Interfaith Institute) because, well, that would be boring. But every now & then we do have something to share with the greater global community that I think may be of interest.

One thing I'm quite proud of is our internship program. We have students from various local colleges (some religious, some secular) who have become passionate about encouraging spiritual diversity on campuses. So with a little bit of training from us, they are encouraged to create their own programming.

If you want to know more, give these episodes from 2016 a listen. You'll catch Allison's enthusiasm for sure. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Islam in the Black Community Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Back in 2016 I was honored to be a guest at the Center for Foreign Relations in NYC for a 2-day conference on politics and religion.  Let me tell you, I was in the midst of some of the greatest minds in the country. I tried to pretended to as smart as I could. I mean, how to you keep up with conversations with folks who insert "I'm working on my 2nd dissertation now" in the 1st minute of chatting?

Please know that I'm not complaining. I loved it. I did meet some interesting people who did end up as guests on this show. And these 2 episodes are examples.

About 16-17 years before I'd interviewed a local imam about the Islam and the urban Black experience. I recently discovered that episode in a box of cassette tapes, and did upload it to this podcast platform. Admittedly, this discussion is very similar. But the sound quality is better. 

You will find Imam Ronald Shaheed a very colorful and brilliant voice.

Enjoy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Birth and Death of Meaning: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on the Problem of Man Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Dr. Brian Bowdle is a Psyche prof at Grand Valley State University, where Common Threads originates. He's also a good friend.  One evening we're together, & start talking about finding meaning in life. Then he brings up a book, "The Birth and Death of Meaning: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on the Problem of Man " by Ernest Becker. I'd never read the book, but it sounded intriguing.  He lent it to me, & after I finished it I told him that this was a good fit for the show. So that's how it ended up here. Enjoy. 

Recorded in 2016. Theme music "Nigal."

      <itunes:summary>Dr. Brian Bowdle is a Psyche prof at Grand Valley State University, where Common Threads originates. He&apos;s also a good friend.  One evening we&apos;re together, &amp; start talking about finding meaning in life. Then he brings up a book, &quot;The Birth and Death of Meaning: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on the Problem of Man &quot; by Ernest Becker. I&apos;d never read the book, but it sounded intriguing.  He lent it to me, &amp; after I finished it I told him that this was a good fit for the show. So that&apos;s how it ended up here. Enjoy.

      <title>Religious Liberty in the Time of Culture Wars  Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[One area where you can get consensus from the Right & Left is the importance of religious liberty. Both cherish this ideal. The problem is that each wing defines it differently. I'm sure we wouldn't have to travel far to find people who believe that they can choose not to serve gay customers, yet also feel that they have a right to ban the construction of mosques in their town. 

. Claire is Outreach and Campaign Manager for the Faith and Progressive Policy Initiative at American Progress.

Prior to joining American Progress, she worked as the field associate and minimum-wage lobbyist for NETWORK, A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby. Previously, she worked in Catholic education as a high school teacher and college campus minister. Much of her professional and academic work has focused on theological foundations for more inclusive faith communities and building communities of faith where political activism is a natural extension of a rich spiritual life. These aired in 2016.

      <title>Absent Mother God In The West Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed these conversations back in 2016 with our guest, Dr. Neela Bhattacharya Saxena. Over the past few decades we have seen a movement to reclaim the concept of feminine divinity  in religions that have suppressed it over the centuries. Neela shares with us her spiritual journey, discovering the power of shakti that permeates Hindu thought. 

Have you ever seen an image of Kali? She looks rather fierce, as you'll hear. It's hard to imagine that so many people resonate with that persona. But indeed they do. 

Join us. You'll enjoy this one. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>A Conversation With a Delightful Man Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[One of my favorite people in interfaith circles in West Michigan has been Len Robinson. This dear friend passed away earlier this year, 2020. I had him on the program several times.  These episodes from 2016 revolve around a recent trip to Israel he'd taken. 

Len was such a great soul. And funny. Whenever there was a panel discussion you did not want to follow him. He left the crowd in stitches, yet still edified.
You really will enjoy this. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>How Enlightenment Changes Your Brain Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This is from 2016.  And a fun fact is that before this interview I was cast to record the audiobook version of this work. So if you really enjoy these episodes, you can either read  or listen to the book.

Andrew Newberg, M.D. joins us on  Common Threads to continue the conversation on his book, How Enlightenment Changes Your Brain.

Dr. Andrew Newberg studies the relationship between brain function and various mental states. He is a pioneer in the neurological study of religious and spiritual experiences, a field known as “neurotheology.” His research includes taking brain scans of people in prayer, meditation, rituals, and trance states, in an attempt to better understand the nature of religious and spiritual practices and attitudes.

      <title>A Lived Life...The Art of Constant Reinvention Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Boy, what do I say about this 2016 conversation? My guest is an enigma wrapped in a riddle. After a successful career as a lawyer, college teacher & commercial actor, Mr. Pitts ended a marriage & disappeared from Grand Rapids, where he'd lived for many years. 
Then one day, perhaps a decade later, I get a call from him. He had taken a fascinating turn. He became a Buddhist monk & teacher. He contacted me because of a desire to work with Interfaith Dialogue Association.  When I shared this information with community members & former friends, they rolled eyes in disbelief. In Mr. Pitts' "former incarnation" he was anything but monk-like. 
Yet, he began to attract students, & built a very solid Buddhist community here in West Michigan that never was before. There were temples in the area that catered to Thai & Vietnamese devotees, but nothing of substance that was attractive to the greater population. The work this man did was amazing. Within a year or 2 the new congregation outgrew one space & procured another. 

And then...

One day, I learned that Mr. Pitts left everything behind, and he, along with a female student, moved to rural New York to open a B&B. Yet another reinvention. 

Regardless of all of this, there is no question that a vital work was created that was bigger than the man who started it. He pulled in very serious students who maintain and grow this effort. Today, the Grand Rapids Meditation & Zen Center continues to thrive.
People have various theories about my guest; not all positive. Regardless, you will hear great wisdom shared in these episodes, I promise.

      <title>The Spiritually Adventurous Journey of Kent Dobson Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I am blown away. Seriously. Here I am uploading these episodes from 2016 that I recorded with Rev. Kent Dobson, when I decide that it would be good to see what the man is up to today. I haven't been in much contact with him since then. Well, to my surprise, he is now the pastor of a church that is pretty much Unitarian-Universalist in everything thing but name. The congregation is called C3, and is located in Grand Haven, Michigan. You might wonder how a church gets a name that sounds like a brand. Well, originally it was Christ Community Church. But they no longer identify as Christian, so this suits them well.

But the wild thing about this is that Kent is from what I term, "The 1st Family of the Evangelical Church" in West Michigan. His father was a lieutenant of Jerry Falwell in the Moral Majority. He was raised to follow in those footsteps.

Kent then went on to pastor at Mars Hill Church, a very successful  effort in the mode of the Emergent Church within Evangelical circles. 

I could go on, but you'll hear everything you need here. But as we conclude our 2nd episode you'll note that he is unsure of what his next step in life will be. 

Glad I found out. Theme music "Nigal."

      <itunes:title>The Spiritually Adventurous Journey of Kent Dobson Parts 1 &amp; 2</itunes:title>

      <itunes:duration>00:56:11</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>I am blown away. Seriously. Here I am uploading these episodes from 2016 that I recorded with Rev. Kent Dobson, when I decide that it would be good to see what the man is up to today. I haven&apos;t been in much contact with him since then. Well, to my surprise, he is now the pastor of a church that is pretty much Unitarian-Universalist in everything thing but name. The congregation is called C3, and is located in Grand Haven, Michigan. You might wonder how a church gets a name that sounds like a brand. Well, originally it was Christ Community Church. But they no longer identify as Christian, so this suits them well.

But the wild thing about this is that Kent is from what I term, &quot;The 1st Family of the Evangelical Church&quot; in West Michigan. His father was a lieutenant of Jerry Falwell in the Moral Majority. He was raised to follow in those footsteps.

Kent then went on to pastor at Mars Hill Church, a very successful  effort in the mode of the Emergent Church within Evangelical circles. 

I could go on, but you&apos;ll hear everything you need here. But as we conclude our 2nd episode you&apos;ll note that he is unsure of what his next step in life will be. 

Glad I found out.</itunes:summary>

      <title>Zoroastrianism--The forerunner of The Judeo-Christian Tradition Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[If you've never studied the teachings of Zoroastrianism I highly suggest these episodes. It occurred to me during my conversation with Sharooz Ash that this religion seems to be a fascinating middle ground between the religions of the Dharma (Hinduism, Buddhism, etc.) & the Abrahamic (Judaism, Christianity, etc.). 

Parsis, (as they are also called) were forced out of Persia (Iran), & settled in India, where they thrive, in terms of literacy, employment, social standing, etc. 

Seriously, give these a good listening to!

      <description><![CDATA[These episodes might not be of interest to many outside of Michigan, but we are proud & pleased that the venerable Aspen Institute took notice of our very progressive interfaith engagement scene here in Grand Rapids. Very few cities have gone where we have to the extent that we have.  No brag, just fact.  So I sat down with Aspen's Joe DeMott to find out just what he found out after spending time here. 

If you are interested  in Joe's report you can find a copy of his report here:

      <description><![CDATA[It is frustrating for many Hindus to see that the common narrative is that they must rely on the beneficence of missionaries for any charitable efforts in basic sustenance, healthcare, disaster relief, etc. In these episodes, Diva Selvakumar, the founder of World Hindu Service attempts to offer an alternative to that thought. I've know Divya for years, & have always been impressed with her sense of compassion & ambition for creating a sustainable org that is focused on the Hindu mandate of service without thought of results or reward.

      <title>Islam in the Black Community</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I suspect that this episode goes back to the beginning--perhaps 1997 or '98. Our guest is Noah Seifullah, who was the imam of the predominantly Black mosque here in Grand Rapids, MI then.  It has been years since he has acted in that capacity. Back in the day Noah was quite a fixture in the interfaith community. He really seemed to drop off the face of the earth. I miss him. 

Noah, like many Black Americans who converted to Islam, was 1st drawn to The Nation of Islam. But like Malcolm X before him, saw through the antisemitism & bigotry, & ended up as a devotee of orthodox Sunni Islam. 

As always with these ancient nuggets, please disregard any events, dates, websites, etc.

      <title>The True Story of an Interfaith Pioneer Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I've got no real date on this one, but I'm suspecting it is from 1998 or 9.  I'll warn you up front that the sound quality is not at all up to snuff. It's been interesting uploading these ancient cassettes. Some sound like they were recorded digitally yesterday. Others, not so much. This would be that.

But the conversation is a good one. Marchiene Reinstra  is one of the co-founders of Interfaith Dialogue Association, & a great friend.  She & her husband live on Lake Michigan, & allow me to use their private beach & deck anytime I'm in the 'hood.

So, this is her story.  She was raised in the Reformed/Calvinist tradition. You'll hear more about that, along with her historic ordination in the episodes. But as she grew spiritually she took a definite turn in a direction few would have predicted.

These episodes require more of a postscript than most. 1st of all, yes, there is a town in West Michigan called Ganges, & it is home to 2 Hindu ashrams. The town was there before the ashrams. They are both part of the Ramakrishna tradition.

 Mother's Place, which was dedicated in 1998, still exists, but they offer no programming whatsoever. A few monastics live there & perform social service for the community. But there is no longer a Westshore Interfaith Institute, no Sunday services, etc. Please ignore all phone numbers, e-mail addresses (Especially Marchiene's Compuserve e-dress!) & virtually everything else about Mother's Place. What's important here is the story of Marchiene's journey from Calvinism to a more expansive multi-faith approach. After Marchiene left Mother's Place she became a minister for Unity Church. I think that is the perfect place for her. She no longer works full time, but does share her wisdom with congregations from time to time.

If this piques your interest, perhaps this article about Rev. Reinstra will answer some questions:

      <title>The God of Intimacy &amp; Action Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[These episodes are among my favorites.  Over the years I have referred people to the book we discuss here many times. These aired in 2007.
Here's the thing, while generalizations go only so far, it's safe to say that much of Evangelical Christianity is based on fear. What I mean is that the parameters for expression of belief & practices are quite narrow. You color outside the lines a bit & you have people questioning your bona fides. Heresy is an easily attainable goal here.
To prove this point, our guest Mary Darling spends much of the time proving that she is not a Hindu or Buddhist. The rest of the time she defends herself from any perceptions that she is Catholic! And I get why. Decades ago Catholics saw that some of their flock were a little too interested in Eastern spirituality. So a movement back to the tradition of meditation began.  More recently, Protestants have discovered value in such practice as well. But the more conservative wings of Jesus followers have looked at all this as something akin to voodoo. 
Mary makes a compelling case for the universal good of contemplative practice. 
Give her a listen. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Nature of Good &amp; Evil in Christianity, Islam &amp; Hinduism</title>
      <description><![CDATA[What a find!  I really thought that the only show I had featuring Marc Evan Jackson was the very 1st one that is in our collection here. Lo & behold, I find another ancient cassette. And the fidelity is excellent.

For those who haven't heard the 1st episode yet, Common Threads started airing on WGVU back in 1996. It was hosted then by Marc. I took over in '97. Marc has gone onto amazing things. He's now a very busy actor living in LA. You can see him on Parks & Rec, Good Place, Brooklyn 99, & other TV comedies. Last I heard he'll be portraying Steve Jobs in a project still in production. So you get to hear his humble beginnings in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

About the guests: These 3 women were responsible for the interfaith work in GR that is so vibrant now.  Both Dorothy & Madhuri have transitioned, but Ghazala Munir continues to be a very active member of our work here.

Go ahead. Give it a listen. Theme music "Nigal."

      <itunes:summary>What a find!  I really thought that the only show I had featuring Marc Evan Jackson was the very 1st one that is in our collection here. Lo &amp; behold, I find another ancient cassette. And the fidelity is excellent.

For those who haven&apos;t heard the 1st episode yet, Common Threads started airing on WGVU back in 1996. It was hosted then by Marc. I took over in &apos;97. Marc has gone onto amazing things.

      <title>Remembrance--A Holocaust Pilgrimage  Parts 1 &amp;2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[These episodes, which aired in 2007, feature an interview with co-founder of IDA Dr. Lillian Sigal. We discuss her journey to Germany where she, along with other interfaith enthusiasts, observed the various ways in which young Germans are attempting to redeem their reputation as a liberal democracy by acknowledging the grave sins of their forebears who were responsible for the heinous genocide we know as Shoah. 

Dr. Sigal refers to this experience as a "pilgrimage." Listen to this very powerful account to find out why. Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[This is from 2001. I interview 2 promoters of Avatar, a for-profit org that "sells enlightenment." OK, that's a bit overblown. But if you search the internet you'll find many ex-members who tell the same sad tale of being taken for a ride by these guys. 

That said, I'm sure there are elements of what they teach that are of value. But I assure you that these bits of wisdom are found in multiple places that don't charge thousands of dollars to learn.  

I recorded a special intro to these episodes to offer context. Theme music "Nigal."

But the messages from the speakers are often timeless. I think these programs really hold up well. They were aired in 2004 as part of our Phillip Sigal Lecture series.

      <title>Joel Beversluis--A Powerful Interfaith Voice in His Time Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[These episodes are from 2000. They feature conversations with one of the most important people in the interfaith movement in West Michigan at that time. Joel Beversluis was an international presence. His passion for multi-religious cooperation drove his life. One of the most important things we discuss is the Millennium Summit that took place earlier that year. 

Sadly, Joel died in 2003. And it just occurs to me at this moment that those who are carrying on his work here in Grand Rapids (where we have such a robust interfaith effort) know nothing about him. We've done nothing to memorialize him. I'm hoping that putting this old show out there might change that.

Joel, if you could only see what we've accomplished, I think you would be proud. 
Just know that we are standing on your shoulders. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Absolutely Fabulous Insanity of a Hindu Wedding Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[What a find this was! I had no memory that we ever even did these shows. But so glad I found this tape. We recorded these episodes sometime in 2001. They feature conversations that I had with my dear, dear friend Madhuri Acharya.  
You will hear me mention that she had the herculean task of pulling off 2 weddings within a year's time. It would be daunting enough if these were Presbyterian or Baptist weddings. But, boys & girls, these were HINDU weddings.  This is a different universe entirely.  And she accomplished these while undergoing treatment for cancer. 
Sadly, we lost our wonderful friend to that cancer in 2003. It makes finding these shows even more precious. So buckle up & let's take a ride to Mumbai.  Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[This is from  2000. It's a  conversation with Rev. Julie Cowey. Please ignore all contact information, event dates, etc. When I post these oldies I like to do a little investigating to see what is current with them. I looked all over the internet, but couldn't find Julie. Also, their Michigan website is no longer. But www.nccj.org does work. 
Those of a  certain age might remember The National Conference of Christians & Jews. Well, this is that renamed.  

This was a good conversation.  Obviously, this work is still needed today. Theme music "Nigal."

      <description><![CDATA[This one is probably from 1998 or 99. Can't swear. But I love hearing my old friend & colleague  Mehdi Lalani discuss both the Sufi & Ismaili traditions of Islam. His knowledge & devotion are palpable.

Mehdi & his family moved from Grand Rapids ages ago. I forget where. I've tried to locate him on social media, but to no avail. I do miss the guy. Theme music "Nigal."

      <itunes:summary>This one is probably from 1998 or 99. Can&apos;t swear. But I love hearing my old friend &amp; colleague  Mehdi Lalani discuss both the Sufi &amp; Ismaili traditions of Islam. His knowledge &amp; devotion are palpable.

Mehdi &amp; his family moved from Grand Rapids ages ago. I forget where. I&apos;ve tried to locate him on social media, but to no avail. I do miss the guy.</itunes:summary>

      <description><![CDATA[This chestnut was just found in the vault (or box, really). It's a cassette of 2 episodes from 1999. Please ignore all the promotion I do for the upcoming event that featured our guest Bishop William Swing.  Feel free to FF through as much as you need. Perhaps I should have edited all that out. Perhaps, but who ever said I was that ambitious?

Anyway, Bishop Swing is a very impressive person. If you have any interest in the interfaith movement you might find this of interest. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>Nothing, Something to Believe In Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[These 2 episodes go back to 2007, when I interviewed Nica Lalli, who wrote the book "Nothing: Something to Believe In." It's the story of a woman who makes her way from the traditions of her birth to an entirely secular life.  I did enjoy this conversation. At the time we were having to deal with several of the "angry atheists" who were grabbing all the headlines. Nica doesn't crank, just shares what makes life meaningful for her. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>The Art of the Sacred Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[So why would you want to listen to a couple of episodes that we used to promote a conference we held in 2006? Well, our 2 outstanding guests are very well schooled in the subject of sacred art. I'm sure I could have had them on to engage in a robust discussion, conference or not.  

By the way, the conference was kind of a flop in terms of numbers. We way overcharged people to attend. But the presentations were excellent. Once again, so sorry about the poor quality of the audio. This is not how it sounded when it aired over radio. But the engineers didn't always pay too close attention to the back up cassette that was running. Levels are too hot. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>A Hero of the Holocaust--An interview with Diet Eman Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Undoubtedly, one of the most powerful conversations I've ever had. Diet (pronounced like the insect repellent) Eman was a part of the the Dutch Resistance. She made tremendous sacrifices to help rescue Jews during their reign of terror. She has been honored by the state of Israel, & led a very public life here in Grand Rapids, MI up until her final years. She died at age 99 in 2019.  We became friends after recording these shows in 2000. If you listen to one podcast of ours this year, this is the one. Theme music "Nigal."

      <title>A Matter of Love: Converting for Marriage</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This episode aired in 1999. It featured my conversation with Elaine Wahab. She  grew up Catholic, but fell in love with & married a devout Muslim man. It's an interesting listen. Some theologians in both camps might find her estimations that the 2 religions are so close in thought a bit simplistic. Others, of course, will say that it doesn't matter. It certainly has worked for them. Today they both stand as a very good example of what a marriage should be. Theme music "Nigal."

      <itunes:summary>Again, digging into the vault. I think this was my favorite episode for a long time. Can&apos;t recall the year specifically, but I know it was the early 00s. Maybe 2002 or 03.

      <itunes:summary>OK, we are reaching way, way back into the vault for this one. It was recorded &amp; aired in 2001. Martin Morris led a very fascinating life, &amp; part of it was spent as part of a worldwide movement called Moral Re-Armament.  To some it was a beacon of liberty, spiritual revival &amp; almost utopian ideals. But to others it grew into what many describe as a cult. 
To those who know Michigan at all, it was headquartered on Mackinac Island. A good friend of mine was a member since childhood, &amp; was deeply scarred from the experience. Our guest Morris fared much better. 
It&apos;s a great show, but I must warn you that the fidelity is especially poor. Remember, this was transferred from a cassette tape that is almost 20 years old. So be patient &amp; enjoy! Our guest died in 2007. I never met him, but he sounded like a delightful man. </itunes:summary>

      <title>The Amazing Story of Steve Bohlert: The Dark Side of Krishna Consciousness Parts 1 &amp; 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[OK Kids, this is quite the tale. These episodes were recorded & aired in January of 2001. I had just met Steve, as you'll hear. His soul journey is one of the most interesting I've come across. He went from beatnik to hippie to Krishna devotee to minister in the United Church of Christ. But he never lost his devotion to Krishna. If what you hear is of interest I recommend you read in much more detail his recollections  at www.stevebohlert.com  

And how about this added bonus? I just pulled this cassette out of the vault (more of a box, really) & found that at the end of the 2nd show the mics were still hot. Just for the fun of it I decided to keep our private conversation intact. I'm allowing you to eavesdrop. 

But wait! There's more! In my "real" life I'm a commercial actor. Among other things, I narrate audiobooks. You can find most of what I've done by searching my name on Audible. Anyway, it was at this time I was nudging my way into the biz. Well, As I'm transferring these shows to MP3 I notice that just after that little post taping conversation I mentioned there was a short segment of me reading from "To Kill a Mockingbird" as an audition. Of course, the real audiobook should be performed by a woman. But the part I read is a great scene to display the ability to do different voices. So what the hey? It's easier to keep it here than to edit it out. So enjoy.  And remember, these older shows I'm posting are taken from 10-20 year old cassette tapes. Please forgive the lack of fidelity.  Theme music "Nigal."

The title comes from the understanding that there are 7 verses in the Bible that condemn homosexuality.

      <description><![CDATA[This episode is from 2007. The subject of caste is a complicated one.  There was wisdom behind its creation, but like so many other ancient traditions, it devolved into a hot mess of bigotry and exclusion. We discuss this.

Our guest has moved onto other efforts since this was aired. But we still admire her passion for human rights. Theme music "Nigal."
