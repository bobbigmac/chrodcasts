The concept seems to have been brought into Christian theology by the church father Tertullian (160–240), who likely borrowed it from Stoic philosophy. Augustine (354–430) wrote a treatise called "On Free Choice of the Will" early in his career but altered some of his views later, which led to much debate and confusion on the issue throughout the Middle Ages.

&#13;
The second article of the Formula of Concord upholds Luther’s biblical teachings on free will but also clarifies misunderstandings about Luther’s teachings that had persisted in the decades after 1525. The central question of this article is: After the fall, what are unregenerate human beings able to do, from their own will and intellect, toward their conversion and regeneration? (See FC SD II 2.) The answer logically follows from the preceding article on original sin, which exposes us as guilty, condemned sinners under God’s wrath. Until the Holy Spirit converts us to Christ, we are powerless to enter a saving relationship with God or even prepare ourselves to receive God’s grace. This teaching also safeguards the truth of the Gospel: God does everything necessary to save us and we, by faith, receive His salvation totally as a gift.&#13;

This year’s “Searching Scripture” will walk through the 12 topics explored by the Formula — original sin, free will, election, Law and Gospel, and so on — in order to examine the biblical basis for what Lutherans confess in this edifying and timeless statement of faith.&#13;
&#13;
Almost 450 years after its publication, the Formula remains relevant. Its topics continue to be points of contention among various Christian denominations. As the Formula confesses, Lutherans unite in concord around teachings drawn from “the true, firm ground of the holy, divine Scriptures” (FC SD Summary 17). Along with the other documents in the Book of Concord, the Formula is not “unnecessary and useless wrangling,” but addresses “articles of faith or the chief points of Christian doctrine” and demonstrates what we “should regard and receive as right and true according to God’s Word of the prophetic and apostolic Scriptures.” It also tells what we “should reject, shun, and avoid as false and wrong” — lest we seek the wrong salvation. “The truth must be preserved distinctly and clearly and distinguished from all errors” (FC SD Summary 15–16). This truth can only be established from God’s Word, which Jesus says “is truth” (John 17:17). We respond, “The sum of Your word is truth, and every one of Your righteous rules endures forever” (Psalm 119:160).&#13;

We confess in the creeds, “I believe in … the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting”; “I look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come.” It is remarkable that these creedal truths were already as good as accomplished thousands of years ago, with prophecies inspired by the Holy Spirit and written down by men such as Job (19:25–27), Daniel (12:2–3) and Isaiah (26:19). Some Christians take Revelation, Daniel, Ezekiel and other prophetic books of the Bible to be “guidebooks to the end times.” However, careful study of both the Old and New Testaments shows that their focus is on comforting the church on earth with knowledge of the victory of Jesus Christ over sin, death and the devil and His promise to take us to Himself for eternity. As we open the Old Testament and see our present and future revealed there, we will need to keep in mind the “prophetic perspective” that could be observed in Jeremiah 31:31–34 and Joel 2:28–32, in which some predictions have been fulfilled in the messianic age but others must wait until the end of time.&#13;

This is not how Christians have historically understood allegory. Even in the Middle Ages, when ingenious allegorical interpretation sometimes resulted in nonsense, Christians still approached the Bible with the conviction that it was literal and historical — they just thought they were finding additional symbolic or spiritual meanings. While the Lutheran Reformation reined in allegorical interpretation of the Bible, there is one divinely inspired allegory given in Scripture that stands alongside messianic prophecy and typology as an interpretive technique for opening the Old Testament. Whether or not St. Paul’s example gives license to Lutherans to do allegory — that’s debatable!&#13;

The Passover lamb was a substitute for the firstborn males of Israel, and St. Paul makes the connection with Jesus explicit when he says, “Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed” (1 Corinthians 5:7). Later in the same Epistle, St. Paul emphasizes the substitutionary work of Jesus, teaching that it was “of first importance … that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures” (1 Corinthians 15:3). In addition to the Passover lamb, there are other substitutes in the Old Testament that point to the person and work of Jesus Christ. These will be the subject of this study.&#13;

LW Searching Scripture, May 2025: Typological Connections Throughout Scripture</title><description>“Type” has to do with forms, shapes, patterns, images. People demonstrate “typical” behavior when they act in a similar pattern time and again. In typesetting, a block with a typographic character on it makes an image of that character on the page. Our first four Bible studies in this year’s series have focused on straightforward messianic prophecies, which abound in the Old Testament. However, Jesus and His church are prefigured in other ways in the Old Testament. This is known as typology — seeing an Old Testament person or event (a “type”) as a pattern for a New Testament one (the “antitype”). This sort of interpretation is employed by the New Testament, which shows us how it can be done responsibly (and not fancifully!). For example, Jesus says, “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him may have eternal life” (John 3:14–15). Here Jesus teaches about Himself and His work by pointing back to Numbers 21:4–9, with the bronze serpent that saved snakebitten Israelites (the type) corresponding to Jesus as One who was lifted up on the cross that we might look to Him in faith and be saved (the antitype). In this study, we will look at more typological connections between the Old Testament and New Testament.&#13;

This is especially true of two central messianic prophecies, Isaiah 52:13–53:12 and Psalm 22, which feature prominently in Holy Week services. In Isaiah 52–53, we gain remarkable details about Jesus’ crucifixion from a prophecy that was written more than 700 years before His death. In Psalm 22, the Holy Spirit inspired David, about 1,000 years before Jesus’ birth, to record words that apply in part to David himself but above all to the Messiah. It would not be a stretch to say that Isaiah 52–53 is a biographical portrait of Jesus Christ, and Psalm 22 is autobiographical, since Jesus took the words of David on His own lips at His crucifixion. Or perhaps we should view it the other way around, with “David’s Son, yet David’s Lord” (LSB 451:1; cf. Matthew 22:41–46) lending the words to His ancestor. Either way, opening the Old Testament leads us straight to Jesus.&#13;

This is especially true of two central messianic prophecies, Isaiah 52:13–53:12 and Psalm 22, which feature prominently in Holy Week services. In Isaiah 52–53, we gain remarkable details about Jesus’ crucifixion from a prophecy that was written more than 700 years before His death. In Psalm 22, the Holy Spirit inspired David, about 1,000 years before Jesus’ birth, to record words that apply in part to David himself but above all to the Messiah. It would not be a stretch to say that Isaiah 52–53 is a biographical portrait of Jesus Christ, and Psalm 22 is autobiographical, since Jesus took the words of David on His own lips at His crucifixion. Or perhaps we should view it the other way around, with “David’s Son, yet David’s Lord” (LSB 451:1; cf. Matthew 22:41–46) lending the words to His ancestor. Either way, opening the Old Testament leads us straight to Jesus.</p><p><br></p><p>Rev.

Much ink has been spilt over the decision of St. Jerome to translate the Greek "diatheke" as "testamentum" in his Latin Vulgate, which ultimately influenced the King James Version’s selection of “testament” as a translation of this term. This, in turn, led to our common division of “Old Testament” (2 Corinthians 3:14) and “New Testament” (Matthew 26:28; Mark 14:24; Luke 22:20; 1 Corinthians 11:25; 2 Corinthians 3:6; Hebrews 9:15). However, diatheke can also mean “covenant,” which is how many recent English translations, such as the ESV, render the term (except in Hebrews 9:16–17, where it opts for “will,” as in, “last will and testament”). Lutherans tend to prefer the translation “testament” over “covenant,” since covenants in the Bible sometimes require works on the part of humans. But in no case does a testament (a will) involve the works of the beneficiary — not to mention that it must be put into effect by the death of the testator. As we will see, even “covenant” can be understood correctly — provided that we pay attention to context and keep in mind the proper distinction between Law and Gospel.&#13;

Peter reminds us that Christians have a much larger family, our “brotherhood throughout the world” (1 Peter 5:9). Paul says something similar in 1 Corinthians 1:2: “To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours.” While we properly focus most of our attention on our local communities of family and congregation, our Lord has a global mission: “This gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come” (Matthew 24:14). Peter’s emphasis on the common suffering of Christians throughout the world is a reminder that we are part of something much greater than ourselves, as Paul also writes: “There is one body and one Spirit — just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call — one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all” (Ephesians 4:4–6).&#13;

If both preachers and hearers heed Peter’s advice, congregations will be blessed with peace and concord; if they don’t, dissension and conflict will ensue. Peter encourages humility for all Christians (1 Peter 5:6–7). Although he doesn’t mention the example of Jesus in this passage, He should be on our minds as we act in humility toward one another and humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God: “Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though He was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross” (Philippians 2:5–8).&#13;

Jesus had promised this would happen to His followers: “If the world hates you, know that it has hated Me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they kept My word, they will also keep yours” (John 15:18–20). But for some reason, we are shocked when His promise comes true in our own lives. Peter helpfully reminds us not to “be surprised” (1 Peter 4:12) when sufferings come but, rather, to “rejoice insofar as you share Christ’s sufferings” (1 Peter 4:13).&#13;

1 Peter 4:7-19&#13;
&#13;
The end of all things is at hand; therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers. 8 Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins. 9 Show hospitality to one another without grumbling. 10 As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God's varied grace: 11 whoever speaks, as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies—in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.&#13;
&#13;
Suffering as a Christian&#13;
&#13;
12 Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. 13 But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. 14 If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory[a] and of God rests upon you. 15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler. 16 Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name. 17 For it is time for judgment to begin at the household of God; and if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God? 18 And&#13;
&#13;
“If the righteous is scarcely saved,&#13;
    what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?”[b]&#13;
&#13;
19 Therefore let those who suffer according to God's will entrust their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good.&#13;

For the first difficult passage, one should ask, “What else could this refer to other than Christ’s victorious descent into hell to proclaim defeat over sin, Satan and the enemies of God?” This is the proper meaning, as we confess in the Apostles’ Creed: Christ “descended into hell.” With the second difficult passage, other Scriptures clarify the meaning: “It is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment” (Hebrews 9:27; see also Luke 16:19–31). “Those who are dead” (1 Peter 4:6) to whom the Gospel has been preached must be those dead in sin (Ephesians 2:1) in this life who need to hear and believe the life-giving Word of Christ.

1 Peter 3:18-4:6&#13;
&#13;
For Christ also suffered[a] once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, 19 in which[b] he went and proclaimed[c] to the spirits in prison, 20 because[d] they formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. 21 Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 22 who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.&#13;
&#13;
Stewards of God's Grace&#13;
&#13;
4 Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh,[e] arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, 2 so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for the will of God. 3 For the time that is past suffices for doing what the Gentiles want to do, living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry. 4 With respect to this they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of debauchery, and they malign you; 5 but they will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. 6 For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the spirit the way God does.&#13;

Peter encourages Christian education oriented toward apologetics, the defense of the Christian faith: “Always [be] prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you” (1 Peter 3:15). Lutherans have a wonderful resource for apologetics in the Small Catechism, which is a foundation and guide for deeper knowledge of the Holy Scriptures. Peter does not encourage Christians to force their faith on others but tells them to be well-prepared to — when asked! — offer a gentle, respectful account of why Christ the Lord is the way, the truth and the life.&#13;

1 Peter 3:8–17&#13;
Suffering for Righteousness' Sake&#13;
&#13;
8 Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind. 9 Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing. 10 For&#13;
&#13;
“Whoever desires to love life&#13;
    and see good days,&#13;
let him keep his tongue from evil&#13;
    and his lips from speaking deceit;&#13;
11 let him turn away from evil and do good;&#13;
    let him seek peace and pursue it.&#13;
12 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,&#13;
    and his ears are open to their prayer.&#13;
But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”&#13;
&#13;
13 Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good? 14 But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, 15 but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect, 16 having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. 17 For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil.&#13;

In current English usage, “hope” usually expresses a wish about something yet to be determined, such as, “I hope I don’t have cancer,” or “I hope the Astros win the World Series.” In the Bible, hope does not convey mere wishfulness; rather, it conveys expectation — patiently waiting for God’s reliable promises in His Word to be fulfilled, since He “has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead” (1 Peter 1:3). Christian hope is not in this life, with all its changes and chances. Paul says, “If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied. But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead” (1 Corinthians 15:19–20). Through Christ, you “are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God” (1 Peter 1:21). Your hope is sure and certain because it rests upon “the word of the Lord [that] remains forever” (1 Peter 1:25).&#13;

1 Peter 1:22–2:3&#13;
&#13;
22 Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart, 23 since you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God; 24 for&#13;
&#13;
“All flesh is like grass&#13;
    and all its glory like the flower of grass.&#13;
The grass withers,&#13;
    and the flower falls,&#13;
25 but the word of the Lord remains forever.”&#13;
&#13;
And this word is the good news that was preached to you.&#13;
&#13;
A Living Stone and a Holy People&#13;
&#13;
2 So put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander. 2 Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation— 3 if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.&#13;

In current English usage, “hope” usually expresses a wish about something yet to be determined, such as, “I hope I don’t have cancer,” or “I hope the Astros win the World Series.” In the Bible, hope does not convey mere wishfulness; rather, it conveys expectation — patiently waiting for God’s reliable promises in His Word to be fulfilled, since He “has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead” (1 Peter 1:3). Christian hope is not in this life, with all its changes and chances. Paul says, “If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied. But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead” (1 Corinthians 15:19–20). Through Christ, you “are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God” (1 Peter 1:21). Your hope is sure and certain because it rests upon “the word of the Lord [that] remains forever” (1 Peter 1:25).</p><p><br></p><p>Rev.

Peter summons Christians to gather as a holy community — consecrated by and set apart for the One who alone is holy, God the Holy Trinity. Whenever Christians fall short of this calling, they inevitably revert to “the passions of [their] former ignorance” (1 Peter 1:14) and “the futile ways inherited from [their] forefathers” (1 Peter 1:18), whether the Gentile proclivity for idolatry and licentiousness or the Jewish inclination toward self-righteousness. Peter wisely guides us away from both antinomianism and legalism by upholding both Law and Gospel as God’s unchanging Word for humanity. He proclaims our redemption from sin by the blood of Christ (1 Peter 1:18–19) while urging sober-mindedness and reverent conduct (1 Peter 1:13, 17). In fact, believers can receive Peter’s quotation of Leviticus 11:44, “You shall be holy, for I am holy” (1 PETER 1:16), as both a command and promise: He will make us holy by His Word, so we must always “be holy in all [our] conduct” (1 Peter 1:15).&#13;

1 Peter 1:13–21&#13;
Called to Be Holy&#13;
&#13;
13 Therefore, preparing your minds for action,[a] and being sober-minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 14 As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, 15 but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, 16 since it is written, “You shall be holy, for I am holy.” 17 And if you call on him as Father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile, 18 knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, 19 but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. 20 He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you 21 who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.&#13;

Philippians 4:8-23&#13;
&#13;
8 Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. 9 What you have learned[a] and received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.&#13;
&#13;
God's Provision&#13;
&#13;
10 I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity. 11 Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. 12 I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. 13 I can do all things through him who strengthens me.&#13;
&#13;
14 Yet it was kind of you to share[b] my trouble. 15 And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only. 16 Even in Thessalonica you sent me help for my needs once and again. 17 Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit.[c] 18 I have received full payment, and more. I am well supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. 19 And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 20 To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.&#13;
&#13;
Final Greetings&#13;
&#13;
21 Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you. 22 All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household.&#13;
&#13;
23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.&#13;

12 Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. 13 Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own.

Philippians 3:7-11&#13;
&#13;
7 But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. 8 Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith— 10 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, 11 that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.&#13;

Philippians 2:19–3:1&#13;
Timothy and Epaphroditus&#13;
&#13;
19 I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by news of you. 20 For I have no one like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare. 21 For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. 22 But you know Timothy's[a] proven worth, how as a son[b] with a father he has served with me in the gospel. 23 I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me, 24 and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also.&#13;
&#13;
25 I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need, 26 for he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill. 27 Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. 28 I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious. 29 So receive him in the Lord with all joy, and honor such men, 30 for he nearly died[c] for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me.&#13;
&#13;
Righteousness Through Faith in Christ&#13;
&#13;
3 Finally, my brothers,[d] rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is no trouble to me and is safe for you.&#13;

Philippians 2:12-18&#13;
Lights in the World&#13;
&#13;
12 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, 13 for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.&#13;
&#13;
14 Do all things without grumbling or disputing, 15 that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, 16 holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. 17 Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. 18 Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me.&#13;

Philippians 2:1-11&#13;
Christ's Example of Humility&#13;
&#13;
2 So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, 2 complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. 3 Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. 4 Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. 5 Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus,[a] 6 who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,[b] 7 but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant,[c] being born in the likeness of men. 8 And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. 9 Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, 10 so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&#13;

Philippians 1:27-2:2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
27 Only let your manner of life be worthy[a] of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel, 28 and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God. 29 For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake, 30 engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.&#13;
&#13;
Christ's Example of Humility&#13;
&#13;
2 So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, 2 complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.&#13;

Philippians 1:12-26&#13;
The Advance of the Gospel&#13;
&#13;
12 I want you to know, brothers,[a] that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel, 13 so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard[b] and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ. 14 And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word[c] without fear.&#13;
&#13;
15 Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. 16 The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. 17 The former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. 18 What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice.&#13;
To Live Is Christ&#13;
&#13;
Yes, and I will rejoice, 19 for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, 20 as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. 21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 22 If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. 23 I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. 24 But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. 25 Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, 26 so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.&#13;

Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. <sup>23 </sup>I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. <sup>24 </sup>But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. <sup>25 </sup>Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, <sup>26 </sup>so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%201&amp;version=ESV" target="_blank">Read full chapter</a></p><p><br></p><h4>Footnotes</h4><ol><li><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+1%3A12-26&amp;version=ESV#en-ESV-29357" target="_blank">Philippians 1:12</a> Or <em>brothers and sisters</em>.

Philippians 1:1-11&#13;
Greeting&#13;
&#13;
1 Paul and Timothy, servants[a] of Christ Jesus,&#13;
&#13;
To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers[b] and deacons:[c]&#13;
&#13;
2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&#13;
Thanksgiving and Prayer&#13;
&#13;
3 I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, 4 always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy, 5 because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now. 6 And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. 7 It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with me of grace,[d] both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel. 8 For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus. 9 And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, 10 so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, 11 filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.&#13;

Ephesians 6:1-24&#13;
Children and Parents&#13;
&#13;
6 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 2 “Honor your father and mother” (this is the first commandment with a promise), 3 “that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land.” 4 Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.&#13;
Bondservants and Masters&#13;
&#13;
5 Bondservants,[a] obey your earthly masters[b] with fear and trembling, with a sincere heart, as you would Christ, 6 not by the way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, 7 rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to man, 8 knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether he is a bondservant or is free. 9 Masters, do the same to them, and stop your threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master[c] and yours is in heaven, and that there is no partiality with him.&#13;
The Whole Armor of God&#13;
&#13;
10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. 11 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. 12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. 13 Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm. 14 Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 15 and, as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace. 16 In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one; 17 and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, 18 praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints, 19 and also for me, that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel, 20 for which I am an ambassador in chains, that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak.&#13;
Final Greetings&#13;
&#13;
21 So that you also may know how I am and what I am doing, Tychicus the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord will tell you everything. 22 I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may encourage your hearts.&#13;
&#13;
23 Peace be to the brothers,[d] and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 24 Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love incorruptible.&#13;

Ephesians 5:22-33&#13;
Wives and Husbands&#13;
&#13;
22 Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. 23 For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. 24 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands.&#13;

25 Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, 26 that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, 27 so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.[a] 28 In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 29 For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, 30 because we are members of his body. 31 “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” 32 This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church. 33 However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.&#13;

Ephesians 5:1-21&#13;
Walk in Love&#13;
&#13;
5 Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. 2 And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.&#13;
&#13;
3 But sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints. 4 Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving. 5 For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. 6 Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. 7 Therefore do not become partners with them; 8 for at one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light 9 (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true), 10 and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord. 11 Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. 12 For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret. 13 But when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible, 14 for anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says,&#13;
&#13;
“Awake, O sleeper,&#13;
    and arise from the dead,&#13;
and Christ will shine on you.”&#13;
&#13;
15 Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, 16 making the best use of the time, because the days are evil. 17 Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. 18 And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit, 19 addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart, 20 giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 21 submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.&#13;

Ephesians 4:17-32&#13;
The New Life&#13;
&#13;
17 Now this I say and testify in the Lord, that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds. 18 They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart. 19 They have become callous and have given themselves up to sensuality, greedy to practice every kind of impurity. 20 But that is not the way you learned Christ!— 21 assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus, 22 to put off your old self,[a] which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, 23 and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, 24 and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.&#13;
&#13;
25 Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another. 26 Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, 27 and give no opportunity to the devil. 28 Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need. 29 Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear. 30 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 31 Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. 32 Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.&#13;

Ephesians 4:1-16&#13;
Unity in the Body of Christ&#13;
&#13;
4 I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called, 2 with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, 3 eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 4 There is one body and one Spirit—just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call— 5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 6 one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. 7 But grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ's gift. 8 Therefore it says,&#13;
&#13;
“When he ascended on high he led a host of captives,&#13;
    and he gave gifts to men.”[a]&#13;
&#13;
9 (In saying, “He ascended,” what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower regions, the earth?[b] 10 He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.) 11 And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds[c] and teachers,[d] 12 to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, 13 until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood,[e] to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, 14 so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. 15 Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, 16 from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.&#13;

11 Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called “the uncircumcision” by what is called the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hands— 12 remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. 14 For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility 15 by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace, 16 and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility. 17 And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near. 18 For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. 19 So then you are no longer strangers and aliens,[a] but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, 20 built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, 21 in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. 22 In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by[b] the Spirit.&#13;

Ephesians 2:1-10&#13;
By Grace Through Faith&#13;
&#13;
2 And you were dead in the trespasses and sins 2 in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— 3 among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body[a] and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.[b] 4 But[c] God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, 5 even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— 6 and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7 so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. 8 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, 9 not a result of works, so that no one may boast. 10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.&#13;

Thanksgiving and Prayer&#13;
&#13;
15 For this reason, because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love[a] toward all the saints, 16 I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers, 17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him, 18 having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, 19 and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his great might 20 that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, 21 far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. 22 And he put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church, 23 which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.&#13;
