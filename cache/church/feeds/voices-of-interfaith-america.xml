      <title>Faith in Elections: How One Evangelical Leader Empowers Latino Voters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of <i>Faith in Elections</i>, Adam Phillips talks with Patricia Ruiz-Cantu, an evangelical leader from Milwaukee, who discusses how her Christian faith inspires her to promote civic engagement within the Latino community. Reflecting on her journey as an immigrant and her conversion from Catholic to Evangelical, she explains challenges Latino voters face, including misinformation. Patricia highlights her initiative, <i>Renaces</i> (You Are Reborn), which focuses on civics education for Latino Evangelicals, and underscores the importance of bringing joy and optimism to election work, even in divisive times.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Guest Bio: </strong>Patricia Ruiz-Cantu, as a Community Outreach Manager at the City of Milwaukee, has over eight years of experience in developing and implementing innovative programs and initiatives that foster authentic human connections and civic engagement among diverse communities. She collaborates with various stakeholders, including faith leaders, media outlets, non-profit organizations, and elected officials, to build trust, collaboration, and awareness on various issues and opportunities that impact the city and its residents. </p><p>In addition to her role as a Community Outreach Manager, Patricia also serves as an Election Commissioner and a Certified Coach, Trainer, and Speaker with The John Maxwell Team. These roles allow her to leverage her skills in conflict resolution, workshop facilitation, and leadership development to empower individuals and groups to achieve their goals and create positive change. As a bilingual and bicultural professional in Spanish and English, she has a unique perspective and ability to communicate effectively across cultures and contexts.</p><p>Find out more about Civics 101 and <i>Renaces</i>  by following Patricia on X @Pruizcantu. </p><p>The identity of “evangelical” contains a wide range of people from across America and the world. We believe they have an important role to play in America’s Diverse Democracy. In collaboration with Christianity Today, Interfaith America has launched a new <a href="https://evangelicalsinadiversedemocracy.com/perspectives/?cat=all&page=1">essay series</a> that equips Christians to live faithfully and neighborly in a world we don’t control.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you've ever wondered what bridgebuilding looks like, look no further than Jenan Mohajir and Rebecca Russo. Just two weeks after the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7th and the subsequent Israeli bombing and invasion of Gaza, Jenan - who is Muslim and the mother of three beautiful Palestinian children - and Rebecca - who is Jewish and has multiple personal and familial connections to Israel (and is also the mother of three beautiful children) - came together to publish an op-ed insisting on "the importance of seeing each other and each other's people as fully human." In this episode, they tackle tough questions about what it means to be Zionist, pro-Palestinian, a committed partisan, and an unwavering bridgebuilder. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Guest Bio:</strong></p><p>Jenan Mohajir is the Vice President of External Affairs at Interfaith America. In this role, Jenan focuses on building strategic relationships and programs with new partners across Interfaith America's emerging sectors. Inspired by faith and family to work for change at the intersections of gender, sexuality, race, and religion, Jenan has served in leadership at IA for 15 years, where she has trained hundreds of interfaith leaders from diverse backgrounds to foster a vision and practice of civically engaged interreligious leadership. Jenan completed undergraduate work at DePaul University and is pursuing her M.A. in religious studies at Chicago Theological Seminary. As a natural storyteller, she performs with 2nd Story, Chicago's premier storytelling company. Jenan proudly lives on the south side of Chicago with her children and loves to collect vintage children's books. </p><p>Rebecca Russo is the Vice President of Higher Education Strategy at Interfaith America. Rebecca oversees I.A.'s higher education strategy in this role, focusing on bridgebuilding programs and partnering with senior campus administrators.

Rebecca has worked in higher education for over a decade, including roles as the Director of Engagement at Northwestern University's Fiedler Hillel and Executive Director of the Campus Climate Initiative at Hillel International. Rebecca holds a B.A. in Middle East Studies from Brown University and an MBA from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. Rebecca is inspired by her interfaith experiences living in Morocco and Jerusalem and by the Talmudic concept of "these and those are words of the living God" to work toward a society where religious diversity is engaged actively and positively.

The Esquire magazine named Ali: A Life is one of the 25 most excellent biographies of all time. Joyce Carol Oates called it "an epic of a biography" that "reads like a novel."
