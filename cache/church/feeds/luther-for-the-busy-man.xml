Mark 7:25</p><p>In this Canaanite woman, we see that true faith is confidence of the heart in the grace and goodness of God, revealed and experienced through God’s Word. St. Mark tells us that she had “heard” of Jesus: a report about Jesus had, somehow or other, reached her. What kind of report? Without a doubt, it was a good report that was being noised about: that Christ was a godly man who readily helped everyone. Such a report about God is real gospel and a word of grace. It awakened faith in this woman, for if she had not believed, she would not have followed after Jesus.</p><p>How does it come to pass that many more heard this good report about Christ, who did not follow after Him and paid no attention to this good report? The answer is that the physician is useful and welcome to the sick, but those who are well pay no attention to Him. The Canaanite woman, however, felt her need, and so she followed this sweet report.</p><p>Moses must also precede here and teach men to recognize their sins so that grace may become sweet and welcome. It is labor lost to portray Christ in the most friendly and lovable manner, unless men have been humbled previously by self-knowledge and hunger for Christ, as the Magnificat also declares, “He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent empty away” (Luke 1:53).</p><p>This is all said and written for those who are distressed, poor, needy, sinful, and despised, so that in all their needs they may know to whom they should flee to seek consolation and help.</p><p>SL.XI.544,1-2<br />AE 76,378</p><p>PRAYER: We know full well, O Lord, that of ourselves and by our merits we are poor, lost, and condemned sinners.

Matthew 4:11</p><p>Finally, the angels came to Him and ministered to Him. This must have taken place in a bodily manner.

For he must have been something higher than a human being to place Him on a pinnacle of the temple and to show Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment. That the devil was something higher than a man is also apparent in his offer of all the kingdoms of the world and the suggestion that Christ should worship him.

We should learn that, where one devil assails us, many angels can minister to us. If we fight manfully and resist the devil, God will not let us suffer want. He will send His angels to minister to us, and at times they can even serve us as our bakers, butlers, and cooks and help us in our every need. This was not written for Christ’s sake; He did not need this. If the angels ministered to Him, they can also minister to us.</p><p>SL.XI.544,27<br />AE 76,374</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, our heavenly Father, send your holy angels to us that, by their ministrations, we may be protected from all harm and danger and ever rest in your grace, in and through our Savior Jesus Christ.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>LENT - WEEK 1 - WEDNESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW+26%3A36-41&version=ESV">MATTHEW 26:36-41</a></p><p>If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>LENT - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW+26%3A36-46&version=ESV">MATTHEW 26:36-46</a></p><p>He was wounded for our transgressions; he was bruised for our iniquities. Isaiah 53:5</p><p>Christ’s passion should help us to a knowledge of self, to be horrified at ourselves, and to bring us to contrition. If this is not the result of Christ’s passion as far as we are concerned, it has not yet achieved its purpose in us. In His passion, Christ placed Himself on an equal footing with us, so that, as He suffered in body and soul in a wretched manner because of our sins, we must also suffer with Him in the knowledge of our sins. This is no matter for many words, but for deep thinking and a proper estimate of our sins.</p><p>Consider this illustration! If a criminal was convicted of murdering the child of a prince or a king, and you were quite unconcerned, sang and played as though you were quite innocent until a terrible attack was launched upon you, and it was proved that you had prevailed upon the criminal to commit his crime. The world would become too narrow for you, especially if your conscience left you in the lurch.</p><p>You should become much more anxious when you ponder the sufferings of Christ. For although the Jews, the criminals, have come under God’s judgement and have been cast off, they were merely the ministers of your sin. You are really the one who, through your sin, throttled and crucified God’s Son.</p><p>SL.XI.578,8<br />AE 76,428</p><p>PRAYER: My sin and guilt, Lord Jesus, were no small part of your passion, suffering, and death. Thank you, Lord, for the riches of your grace and mercy and, above all, for your wonderful love to me and all other sinners. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>LENT - ASH WEDNESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+32%3A1-7&version=ESV">PSALM 32:1-7</a></p><p>If thou, O Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand? But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. Psalm 130:3,4</p><p>David says in the psalm, “I acknowledged my sin to thee, and I did not hide my iniquity; I said, ‘I will confess my transgressions to the Lord;’ then thou didst forgive the guilt of my sin” (Psalm 32:5). No one can stand before God without bringing this confession of sins with him. That is why the psalmist also declares; “If thou, O Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand? But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared” (Psalm 130:3,4).</p><p>Anyone who really wants to stand before God must be quite sure that this confession of sins really comes from his heart and firmly believe that, unless the Lord is merciful to him, all is lost, no matter how pious he is in himself. Even all the saints must acknowledge the need of God’s continual grace and mercy and in all humility confess their sins before Him.</p><p>There is no difference here, for all have sinned. If anyone has received special grace, thank God for it and do not boast. If anyone has fallen into sin, it simply demonstrates that he is flesh and blood. But no one has fallen so deeply that one who stands may not fall ever deeper. As far as we are concerned, there is no difference between us and others; it is God’s grace alone that divides us from others.</p><p>This confession of sin is so necessary that we dare not overlook it for a moment. It must be our concern during our whole life as a Christian. Without ceasing we must evermore praise God’s grace and recognize that all boasting on our part is vain before God.</p><p>SL.XI.584,4-5<br />AE 76,434</p><p>PRAYER: Because of your wonderful grace, Lord God, loving heavenly Father, we poor sinners can stand before you, confessing our sins. When we do this, give us the assurance of the forgiveness of sins, in and through our Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF QUINQUAGESIMA - SUNDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW+26%3A1-13&version=ESV">MATTHEW 26:1-13</a></p><p>The next day, he saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” John 1:29</p><p>In many people, the passion of Christ arouses little more than sympathy. They lament and bemoan the fact that He suffered innocently. A great multitude of women followed Jesus near the end of His public ministry “who bewailed and lamented him.” Jesus tried to set them right when He said to them, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children” (Luke 23:28).</p><p>Along these lines, many make rather wide excursions during the passion season. They make a lot of the sad farewell of Jesus from His friends at Bethany, with rather liberal portions of the pains and sorrows of the Virgin, but they hardly get any further than this. In this way, Christ’s passion is inordinately delayed so that God only knows whether it was thought up to put men to sleep rather than to keep them awake. In this same group we must place those who teach that much benefit is derived during the passion season from various holy exercises, fasts, and special devotions.</p><p>If we are not reminded of Christ’s sufferings on our behalf in all this, it becomes nothing but an unfruitful work, no matter how good and worthy it may be in itself. What does it help you for God to be God if He is not God for you? What use is there in the healthiness and goodness of eating and drinking if it is not healthy for you? This is exactly the situation in regard to special Lenten exercises when men do not seek the correct benefit from them.</p><p>SL.XI.576,3<br />AE 76,426</p><p>PRAYER: Dear Lord, instruct our faith so that we always view your passion as a suffering for us and on our behalf, a work of love which you assumed as our Savior and Redeemer. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF SEXAGESIMA - SATURDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=EPHESIANS+3%3A7-13&version=ESV">EPHESIANS 3:7-13</a></p><p>To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God. Luke 8:10</p><p>What does He mean when He says: “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God”? What is a “secret” here? If one cannot know it, why does one preach it?</p><p>“Secret” means a hidden, concealed matter which one does not know, and “the secrets of the kingdom of God” are the matters in God’s kingdom which are hidden. Christ, with all the grace He has manifested to us as Paul describes Him, is one of these “secrets.” He who knows Christ aright knows what God’s kingdom is and what it contains.</p><p>This is called a “secret” because it is spiritual and concealed and remains so unless the Spirit reveals it.

They do not believe it themselves and have no real experience of it, for as Paul declares, “This unspiritual man does not receive the gifts of the Spirit of God” (1 Corinthians 2:14).</p><p>So, Christ says here, “To you it has been given,” that is, the Holy Spirit has enabled you not to hear and to see, but to recognize and to believe with your hearts, and, therefore, it is no longer a “secret” for you.</p><p>SL.XI.523,19<br />AE 76,337</p><p>PRAYER: Thanks and praise be to you, O heavenly Father, for the revelation of the mystery of your grace in Christ Jesus our Lord which you have made known to us in the Gospel.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF SEXAGESIMA - FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+31%3A15-24&version=ESV">PSALM 31:15-24</a></p><p>O send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me, let them bring me to thy holy hill and to thy dwelling! Psalm 43:3</p><p>After hearing the Word, large numbers fall away from it and bring no fruit to perfection. We are told this for our learning so that we should not be led into error.</p><p>It is certainly unpleasant to preach to those who treat the Word so disgracefully and especially set themselves against the Gospel. For this is preaching which is to become so general that it is to be presented to all creatures, as Christ declares, “Preach the gospel to the whole creation” (Mark 16:15), and as the psalmist puts it, “Their voice goes out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world” (Psalm 19:4).</p><p>What if many do despise the Word?

For the sake of those who are good seed and who bring forth fruit with patience, seed must also fall in vain on the path, on the rock, and among the thorns.</p><p>Of one thing we can be sure, and that is that God’s Word never departs without producing fruit. It always finds some good ground, as the Gospel also says here, that some of the sower’s seed fell on good ground and not only on the path, among the thorns, and on the rock. For wherever the Gospel reaches, there are Christians. “My word shall not return to me empty” (Isaiah 55:11).</p><p>SL.XI.520,10<br />AE 76,334</p><p>PRAYER: Grant, O Lord, that the saving power of your Gospel may always be a real incentive for us to spread the teachings of the Gospel in word and deed, for Christ our Savior’s sake.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>EPIPHANY III - SATURDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+THESSALONIANS+2%3A13-16&version=ESV">1 THESSALONIANS 2:13-16</a></p><p>When Jesus heard him, he marveled, and said to those who followed him, Truly, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.” Matthew 8:10</p><p>The words of Jesus to the centurion have caused no end of trouble to the commentators. They have raised the question whether Jesus really told the truth in these words. On the basis of these words, one would have to infer that the mother of Jesus and His apostles were inferior to this centurion.</p><p>I would like to point out here that Christ is speaking of the people of Israel to whom He had preached and to whom He had come, and that His mother and apostles are really excluded because they were normally a part of His company. Nevertheless I will still stick quite simply to the words of the Lord and take them just as they read.</p><p>It is not contrary to any article of the faith to believe that the faith of this centurion did not have any parallel among the apostles or even in the faith of God’s mother. Where Christ’s words do not conflict openly with an article of faith, we must allow them to stand just as they read, and not twist them or guide them by our expositions and interpretations, not even for the sake of a saint, or an angel, or even for God’s own sake. For God’s Word is the very truth above all saints and angels.</p><p>SL.XI.483,13</p><p>AE 76,254</p><p>PRAYER: Your Word, O God, is the truth and the whole truth. Grant us, at all times, such a faith that we trust you fully in your Word and derive from it the full confidence of salvation in and through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

For such a faith would be quite worthless, even if he did believe that Christ was almighty and able to do all things in His omniscience.

Nevertheless, through love we are to do good to our neighbor, just as Christ was born a man to help us all. Just as Christ became man only to serve us after being God in eternity, we also do good to our neighbor and show him our love only after we have become righteous, free from sin, living and blessed children of God.</p><p>SL.XI.481,7</p><p>AE 76,252</p><p>PRAYER: By faith in Christ you have made us free lords and kinds, O God, thus conferring upon us all the spiritual blessings we need for our salvation.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>EPIPHANY III - TUESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=GALATIANS+2%3A11-16&version=ESV">GALATIANS 2:11-16</a></p><p>We hold that a man is justified by faith apart from works of law.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>EPIPHANY II - WEDNESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROMANS+14%3A5-12&version=ESV">ROMANS 14:5-12</a></p><p>So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. 1 Corinthians 10:31</p><p>The reason why excess is so frequent among men is that they do not just eat and drink, but gorge themselves and guzzle, carouse and gormandize, and behave as though it were a mark of cleverness or strength to gorge and guzzle. Their objective is not to become joyful, but to become mad and to be full. These people are pigs, not human beings. Christ would not have given such people wine or accepted their invitation.</p><p>In their adornment, also, such people have no consideration for a wedding but to show themselves off, and to prance around as though the strongest are the best. They are loaded with gold, silver, and pearls, and do their best to wear as much silk and fine clothes as possible. Donkeys and blockheads could easily do the same.</p><p>How, then, is moderation to be determined? Reason should be our pride here. We should follow the example of other lands and cities where such excess is not the order of the day. Each one according to his estate! So also with food and drink and other similar matters. Is it sin to have music and dance at a wedding, seeing that it is claimed that there is much sin in connection with dancing? I do not know whether the Jews danced; but because it is customary among us, just as inviting guests, adornment, eating, and being joyful is customary, I cannot condemn dancing if it does not involve any excess or become lewd. If it involves sin, it is not the fault of the dancing itself. People can sin sitting at table or even in church! So also with eating and drinking. If dancing were sinful, it would have to be denied even to children.</p><p>SL.XI.467,9</p><p>AE 76, 241</p><p>PRAYER: As your children in Christ Jesus, O Lord, you have given us all things for our happiness and enjoyment. In this connection grant us the moderation and a sense of what is fitting and proper, so that our lives may always be happy and joyful in all good conscience. Amen.</p>

They were not children of the devil, even if some of them exceeded the needs of quenching their thirst and became merry. Otherwise you will have to reckon it as a fault in Christ that He was the cause of this with His gift, and also His mother who requested it.

John 2:1,2</p><p>It was a great honor for Jesus to make His gift of wine at this lowly marriage feast by means of a great miracle. Hereby Jesus became the bride’s most important donor. In any case, He may not have had any money for precious gems to give her as a gift. Such an honor Jesus never accorded to any of the Pharisees.

Romans 15:4</p><p>In this Gospel (Luke 2:41-52) we are given the consolation that, whenever suffering becomes our portion, we should realize that we will not be able to find any other consolation except in the Scriptures, the Word of God. God has set it down in writing that we should learn, as Paul says, “Whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope.” Romans 15:4.</p><p>Here he states that the Scriptures are comforting and give patience and consolation. There is nothing else that comforts the soul more, even in the slightest temptations. For anything else whereby a man seeks consolation for himself, however great it may be, is quite uncertain. For the heart always has the nagging feeling: “Who knows whether it is right? O that I could be quite sure!” When the heart clings to God’s Word, it can say without any wavering: “This is God’s Word; it cannot lie to me or mislead me.

If this Word is torn from a man’s heart, he is lost.</p><p>SL.XI.441,29</p><p>PRAYER: Grant us steadfastness of faith, O Lord, so that the precious Word of salvation which you have made known to us in Christ, our Savior, may never be torn from our hearts, and that we may continue in it until all our hopes are fully realized in Christ. Amen</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>EPIPHANY I - MONDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JAMES+1%3A12-15&version=ESV">JAMES 1:12-15</a></p><p>We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed but not driven to despair. 2 Corinthians 4:8</p><p>When God has given us a fine, strong faith so that we go forth in firm confidence, and are quite sure and certain that we have a gracious God on whom we can fully rely, we are in paradise. But when God suffers our heart to slip away from us, so that we come to think that God wants to tear the Lord Jesus from our hearts, and our conscience feels that we have lost Him, and then flounders and loses courage, so that our confidence sinks, the result is wretched distress.</p><p>Even if our conscience cannot recall any particular sins it is still in such wretched condition that it thinks, “Who knows if God really wants me?” just as Mary begins to have her doubts (Luke 2:41-51), so that she no longer knows whether God still wants her as a mother. When the heart receives such blows it is inclined to say, “It is true that hitherto God has given you a fine faith; but perhaps He wants to take your faith from you and no longer have you.” It requires a strong faith to withstand such knocks, and there are not many whom God assails in this way. But we must prepare ourselves so that we do not despair if this should happen to us.</p><p>SL.XI.432,7</p><p>AE 76,</p><p>PRAYER: Heavenly Father, strengthen our faith through your Word and Sacraments, that we may successfully overcome all trials and temptations we may meet in life, and stand firm and steadfast in the confidence that we are always more than conquerors in and through Jesus Christ, our Savior. Amen.</p>

But when God suffers our heart to slip away from us, so that we come to think that God wants to tear the Lord Jesus from our hearts, and our conscience feels that we have lost Him, and then flounders and loses courage, so that our confidence sinks, the result is wretched distress.</p><p>Even if our conscience cannot recall any particular sins it is still in such wretched condition that it thinks, “Who knows if God really wants me?” just as Mary begins to have her doubts (Luke 2:41-51), so that she no longer knows whether God still wants her as a mother. When the heart receives such blows it is inclined to say, “It is true that hitherto God has given you a fine faith; but perhaps He wants to take your faith from you and no longer have you.” It requires a strong faith to withstand such knocks, and there are not many whom God assails in this way. But we must prepare ourselves so that we do not despair if this should happen to us.</p><p>SL.XI.432,7</p><p>AE 76,</p><p>PRAYER: Heavenly Father, strengthen our faith through your Word and Sacraments, that we may successfully overcome all trials and temptations we may meet in life, and stand firm and steadfast in the confidence that we are always more than conquerors in and through Jesus Christ, our Savior. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>EPIPHANY I - SUNDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=LUKE+2%3A41-52&version=ESV">LUKE 2:41-52</a></p><p>When they saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, you father and I have been looking for you anxiously.” Luke 2:48</p><p>Although the holy mother Mary who was blessed (Luke 1:42) and highly-favored with all kinds of grace (Luke 1:28) without a doubt found the greatest of happiness and joy in her child, the Lord still governed her in such a way that she should not have her paradise in Him and reserve it for her future life, as He does also in the case of others. And so on earth she also had to suffer her share of misfortune, pain, and sorrow.</p><p>The first distress that came upon her was that she had to give birth at Bethlehem, a strange place, in which there was no room for herself and her child except in a stable.

      <title>Epiphany Wednesday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h3>EPIPHANY WEDNESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: HEBREWS 10:19‒25</p><p>The blood of Jesus His [God’s] Son cleanses us from all sin. 1 John 1:7</p><p>We must take hold of Christ’s words in the Sacrament and be quite sure that we understand them. For the whole power and might of the Sacrament depends on these words. We must all know them, understand them, and cling to them in firm faith so that we may defend ourselves with them and, when the need arises, repulse our enemies with them.

On these words we must take our stand.

But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a custodian; for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. For as many of you were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. Galatians 3:23-27</p><p>The Apostle Paul observes an excellent flow of thought in this context. He says, “Now that faith has come, we are no longer under a custodian.” Why so? “In Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith.” How does it come to pass that we become God’s children? “As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.”</p><p>Christ is God’s child. Therefore, he who clothes himself in God’s child, is also God’s child, for he steps forth as God’s adopted child, which certainly makes him God’s child. If he is God’s child, he is not under the subjection of the Law, in the position of an abject slave, but free. When we put on Christ in baptism His righteousness becomes our righteousness, and thus all the claims that the Law can make on us are fulfilled, and we are now God’s free children in Christ.</p><p>SL.XII.265,51<br />AE 76,15</p><p>PRAYER: In your mercy and peace, O Lord, you have freed us from the curse of the Law and made us your free children in Christ.

Galatians 3:26</p><p>The reason why St. Paul always stresses the need of faith in Christ is because he knew that men would have the presumption actually to suggest that man can have dealings with God outside of Christ, just as if God and our human nature were quite good friends, and as though righteousness were quite fond of sin and gave ear to the promptings of sin. Therefore, let us be wise and recognize Christ aright, namely, that before all else we should hear the Gospel and believe.</p><p>Christ is set forth in the Gospel not just for His sake, as an exalted character, but because He is the man who took the place of our sinful nature, loaded Himself with the whole wrath of God, that wrath which we merited despite all our works, and rendered it satisfaction. All who believe that they have this in and from Him will certainly be saved through Him from the same wrath of God, and obtain His grace.</p><p>From this we should learn what great need we have of Christ, and of what great use He is to us. Moreover, the idea that a man can do all this for himself, and that God’s grace is given him by his natural powers, is a lie of the devil himself. For if nature can obtain grace there is no need of Christ as a substitute and a mediator.</p><p>SL.XII.265, 50<br />AE 76,3</p><p>PRAYER: Thanks be to you, Lord Jesus, for all that you took upon yourself as our substitute and mediator.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE THIRD DAY OF CHRISTMAS - CHRISTMAS III</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JOHN+1%3A1-14&version=ESV">JOHN 1:1-14</a></p><p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. John 1:1</p><p>“The Word was with God.” Where else could the Word be? Outside of God there was nothing. Moses also says this when he writes, “And God said, ‘Let there be light.’” Genesis 1:3. In order to speak, He had to have the Word with Him.</p><p>There is a clear distinction made here in the persons of the Godhead: the Word is a different person from the God with whom He was. This statement of John does not allow us to suppose that God was alone, because he states that something was with God, namely, His word.</p><p>If there has been only a single person there, why would he say, “The Word was with God”? To have something “with” Him is not being alone or by Himself. We should note particularly that the evangelist places special stress on the “with.” He repeats it (v.2) in order to give clear expression to the personal distinction in the Godhead and to counter the arguments of natural reason and future heretics.</p><p>Since natural reason more easily comprehends the fact that there is only one God and this doctrine is supported by many passages of Scripture and this doctrine is also true, natural reason still finds it very difficult to accept the fact that this same God is more than one person. The Son is a different person from the Father, but He is not a different God.<br />SL.XI.161,21<br />AE 75,277</p><p>PRAYER: Great indeed, O God, is the mystery of our religion. Your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, the Word who was with you at the beginning and who is truly God, was manifested in the flesh to be our Savior and Redeemer. Thanks be to you, O God, for your inexpressible love! Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE SECOND DAY OF CHRISTMAS - CHRISTMAS II</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=LUKE+2%3A15-20&version=ESV">LUKE 2:15-20</a></p><p>They made known the saying which had been told them concerning this child. Luke 2:17</p><p>The faith of the shepherds produced action. St. Paul says, “The kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power.” 1 Corinthians 4:20. So also here. The shepherds do not only say, “Let us go and see!” but they actually went; indeed, they do more than they say. For the text says, “They went with haste.” This is more than just going as they had proposed to do. Faith and love always do more than they actually propose to do, and whatever they do is always something living, busy, active, and abundant.</p><p>A Christian must be a man of few words, rich in deeds. He proves himself such if he is a true Christian. If he does not prove his faith in deeds, he is not yet a true Christian.</p><p>The shepherds also confess and openly proclaim the word which was told them concerning this child. This is one of the most important duties in Christian life. One must risk body and life, property and honor. For the evil spirit does not launch such a heavy attack against correct belief and a good life in secret, but he will not abide it if we venture forth to spread the faith, confess, preach, and praise it for the sake of others. So Luke says here that the shepherds not only came to see something, but they also made known what they had heard on the field, not only before Mary and Joseph, but before all men.</p><p>SL.XI.149,18-19<br />AE 75,248</p><p>PRAYER: Grant us the joyful faith of the shepherds, O Lord, that we may go forth as witnesses, confessing you and your salvation to all our fellowmen. Amen.</p>

His confession is the confession of Christ when he says that he is not the Christ. He confessed: “I am not the Christ.” His confession also includes the confession that he is not Elijah or a prophet. When John declares that “he did not deny,” it means that he confessed who he was in stating that he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness and preparing the way of the Lord.</p><p>His confession is a free confession, which confesses not only what he is not, but also what he is. For that part of a confession in which one confesses what he is not, is still dark and incomplete, and from which it is impossible to know what and how one should think of a man.</p><p>But here John openly states what one should think of him, as well as what one should not think of him. He leaves no grounds for uncertainty, inasmuch as he confesses that he is not the Christ, and does not deny that he is the voice preceding His coming. Inasmuch as he stands quite firm and confesses what he is, and what he is not, his action is a precious confession before God and no denial.</p><p>SL.XI.100,10<br />AE 75,174</p><p>PRAYER: In your mercy and grace, O Lord, give us a clear and certain faith which knows what is right and good in your sight, and acts accordingly without any fear of consequences.

And blessed is he who takes no offense at me.” Matthew 11:4-6</p><p>Our faith is strengthened and improved inasmuch as Christ is set before us in His own simple works. He is simply concerned with the blind, lame, lepers, deaf, the dead, and the poor, and has nothing but pure love and well-doing for all who are poor and needy. In short, Christ is nothing else but a consolation and a refuge for all who have a troubled and weakened conscience.</p><p>Here there is need of faith that builds on His Gospel and relies on it without any doubt that Christ is just as His Gospel portrays Him.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE SECOND WEEK OF ADVENT - SATURDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROMANS+15%3A4-13&version=ESV">ROMANS 15:4-13</a></p><p>And he told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree, and all the trees; as soon as they come out in leaf, you see for yourselves and know that the summer is already near. So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near.” Luke 21:29-31</p><p>These are words of sheer joy! Jesus does not give a parable for autumn or winter when the trees are bare and it is a gloomy time of the year. He gives us a parable for spring and summer which is a joyful, happy time, when all creatures revive and are joyful. Hereby it is very clearly taught that we should look forward to the last day and console ourselves with the gladness and eager longing with which all creatures joyfully await the spring and the summer.</p><p>What else could this parable suggest to us if that is not what the Lord is teaching here?

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>THE SECOND WEEK OF ADVENT - SATURDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROMANS+15%3A4-13&version=ESV">ROMANS 15:4-13</a></p><p>And he told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree, and all the trees; as soon as they come out in leaf, you see for yourselves and know that the summer is already near. So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near.” Luke 21:29-31</p><p>These are words of sheer joy! Jesus does not give a parable for autumn or winter when the trees are bare and it is a gloomy time of the year. He gives us a parable for spring and summer which is a joyful, happy time, when all creatures revive and are joyful. Hereby it is very clearly taught that we should look forward to the last day and console ourselves with the gladness and eager longing with which all creatures joyfully await the spring and the summer.</p><p>What else could this parable suggest to us if that is not what the Lord is teaching here? Here He is telling us, “It will not mean hell and condemnation for you, but the kingdom of God”.</p><p>Therefore, look to your life and search your heart to determine how you are minded as far as the last day is concerned. Do not rely on your good life, for it can soon put you to shame! Strengthen your faith so that this day does not overtake you unawares with those who are damned and perverse. May you eagerly wait for it, and when you hear it mentioned, or think of it, may your heart leap for joy.</p><p>SL.XI.66,51-53<br />AE 75,107</p><p>PRAYER: Lead us at all times by your grace, O Lord, that we eagerly await your coming as the consummation of all our hopes and joy. Amen.</p>

      <title>Advent  II - Monday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE SECOND WEEK IN ADVENT - MONDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+PETER+3%3A1-11&version=ESV">2 PETER 3:1-11</a></p><p>When these things begin to take place, look up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near. Luke 21:28</p><p>You might feel inclined to say in this context, “Who could possibly raise his head in the face of such wrath and judgement? Will not the whole world rather lower its head in terror and look downwards in fear and dismay? How are we in such a situation to look up and raise our heads?” The latter without a doubt signifies joy and eager longing.</p><p>The answer to this is: All this is spoken to Christians alone – to real Christians, not to the heathen or the Jews. Real Christians are involved in great temptations and persecutions from sins and all kinds of evil, so that this life often becomes distasteful and quite ugly for them. And so they wait with eager longing and pray to be delivered from sins and all evil, as is also said in the Lord’s Prayer: “Thy kingdom come,” and “deliver us from evil.”</p><p>If we are real Christians, we will also pray this earnestly from the depths of our heart. If we do not pray this earnestly from our hearts, we are not yet real Christians.</p><p>SL.XI.61,37<br />AE 75,92</p><p>PRAYER: O Lord, you have so often promised in your Word to deliver us from all the trials and tribulations which we experience in a world of sin and sadness. Receive us into your heavenly kingdom, for your truth’s sake. Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>THE SECOND WEEK IN ADVENT - MONDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+PETER+3%3A1-11&version=ESV">2 PETER 3:1-11</a></p><p>When these things begin to take place, look up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near. Luke 21:28</p><p>You might feel inclined to say in this context, “Who could possibly raise his head in the face of such wrath and judgement? Will not the whole world rather lower its head in terror and look downwards in fear and dismay? How are we in such a situation to look up and raise our heads?” The latter without a doubt signifies joy and eager longing.</p><p>The answer to this is: All this is spoken to Christians alone – to real Christians, not to the heathen or the Jews. Real Christians are involved in great temptations and persecutions from sins and all kinds of evil, so that this life often becomes distasteful and quite ugly for them. And so they wait with eager longing and pray to be delivered from sins and all evil, as is also said in the Lord’s Prayer: “Thy kingdom come,” and “deliver us from evil.”</p><p>If we are real Christians, we will also pray this earnestly from the depths of our heart. If we do not pray this earnestly from our hearts, we are not yet real Christians.</p><p>SL.XI.61,37<br />AE 75,92</p><p>PRAYER: O Lord, you have so often promised in your Word to deliver us from all the trials and tribulations which we experience in a world of sin and sadness. Receive us into your heavenly kingdom, for your truth’s sake. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE SECOND WEEK OF ADVENT - SUNDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=LUKE+21%3A25-33&version=ESV">LUKE 21:25-33</a></p><p>Then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. Luke 21:27</p><p>Here you can interpret “power” as referring to the host of angels, saints, and all creatures who will accompany Christ on His coming to judgement. This I consider to be the correct interpretation. The evangelist does not just say, “He will come,” but “they will see the Son of man coming.”</p><p>He also came into the world by bodily birth, but that coming was seen by no one. He also comes daily into the hearts of believers in a spiritual manner by means of the Gospel. This coming is also seen by no one.</p><p>But his second coming will take place in a public manner in which all men will see Him, as is declared in the book of Revelation: “every eye will see him” [1:7]. They will see that He is none other than the human being Jesus Christ in bodily form, as He was born of Mary and recognized here on earth. He could have merely said, “they will see Me,” without any obvious reference to His human form. But He says here that they will see the Son of man. By this He clearly states that He is referring to a bodily seeing of Himself in human form.</p><p>This will take place in great power, with a great host of angels and in great glory. He will sit on a bright cloud and with Him He will bring all the saints. Of His coming, Scripture speaks quite often. It is something of very great importance.<br />SL.XI.60,36<br />AE 75,91</p><p>PRAYER: Lord, keep us ever mindful of your second glorious coming to judgement so that we, with all your saints, may ever dwell with you in the blessed kingdom you have prepared for us, for your love’s sake. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE FIRST WEEK IN ADVENT - THURSDAY </h3><p><i>LESSON: PSALM 25:1-10 </i></p><p>Your king is coming to you. Matthew 21:5 </p><p>Learn from this Gospel what happens when God begins to make us godly, and what is the beginning of becoming godly. There is no other beginning but the fact that your King comes to you and begins to work in you.  </p><p>This comes to pass as follows. The Gospel must be the very first thing in this context; it must be preached and heard. In this you hear and learn how your work is nothing before God and that all you do or attempt is sin. But your King must be in you beforehand and rule you. That is the beginning of your salvation. You then give up your own work, and despair of self, because you hear and see that your own work is nothing, as the Gospel tells you. You begin to receive your King through faith, you cling to Him, invoke His grace, and entrust yourself solely to His goodness.  </p><p>That you hear and accept this is also not of your own strength but of God’s grace, which has made the Gospel fruitful in you, so that you believe Him when He declares that your own work is nothing.  </p><p>You see how few there are who accept His grace. Jesus also wept over Jerusalem. The papists not only reject this doctrine but actually condemn it. They do not want their own work to be sin and nothing. They want to lay the first stone and they rage and storm against the Gospel.  </p><p>SL.XI.8,23<br />AE 75,35 </p><p><strong>PRAYER</strong>: O Lord, take from our hearts all self-pride and trust in our own works and efforts, and grant us grace to trust solely and wholly in your mercy and grace, granted us through our Lord Jesus Christ.

      <title>Advent I - Wednesday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>THE FIRST WEEK IN ADVENT - WEDNESDAY</strong></p><p><i>LESSON: PSALM 24</i></p><p>Your king. Matthew 21:5</p><p>Here this King is separated from all other kings. He is “your king,” the one promised to you and whose own you are. He is the one who rules you and no one else. But His rule is a spiritual, not a secular, rule.</p><p>This is a comforting word for the believing heart, for apart from Christ, man is subjected to many raging tyrants who are not kings but murderers. Under these he endures great misery and terror.</p><p>Such tyrants include the devil, the flesh, the world, and sin, as well as the law, death, and hell. At the hands of all these the wretched conscience is oppressed, suffers heavy imprisonment, and lives a bitter, uneasy life. For where sins are, there is no conscience; where there is no good conscience, everything is quite uncertain and there is unending fear of death and hell before which there can be no firm joy or delight in the heart. As Moses declares, such a heart is terrified at the rustling of a leaf (Leviticus 26:36).</p><p>Wherever a heart receives this King in firm faith, it becomes established and does not fear sin, death, hell, or any misfortune. It knows and does not doubt that this King is the Lord over life and death, sin and grace, hell and heaven, and that all things are in His hands.</p><p><strong>PRAYER:</strong> Lord Jesus Christ, my King, establish your rule in my heart in such a way that my heart becomes your throne, and peace and joy may reign therein for evermore. Amen.</p>

Matthew 21:5</p><p>Here this King is separated from all other kings. He is “your king,” the one promised to you and whose own you are. He is the one who rules you and no one else. But His rule is a spiritual, not a secular, rule.</p><p>This is a comforting word for the believing heart, for apart from Christ, man is subjected to many raging tyrants who are not kings but murderers. Under these he endures great misery and terror.</p><p>Such tyrants include the devil, the flesh, the world, and sin, as well as the law, death, and hell. At the hands of all these the wretched conscience is oppressed, suffers heavy imprisonment, and lives a bitter, uneasy life. For where sins are, there is no conscience; where there is no good conscience, everything is quite uncertain and there is unending fear of death and hell before which there can be no firm joy or delight in the heart. As Moses declares, such a heart is terrified at the rustling of a leaf (Leviticus 26:36).</p><p>Wherever a heart receives this King in firm faith, it becomes established and does not fear sin, death, hell, or any misfortune. It knows and does not doubt that this King is the Lord over life and death, sin and grace, hell and heaven, and that all things are in His hands.</p><p><strong>PRAYER:</strong> Lord Jesus Christ, my King, establish your rule in my heart in such a way that my heart becomes your throne, and peace and joy may reign therein for evermore. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE FIRST WEEK IN ADVENT – TUESDAY</h3><p><i>LESSON: HEBREWS 10:19-25</i></p><p>Behold! Matthew 21:5</p><p>“Behold!” Mark this word well. With this word the Holy Spirit wakens us from sleep and unbelief as one who wants to set forth something important, strange, and noteworthy which one has long desired and should receive with joy. And we really need such an awakening, because our reason and nature despises all that concerns faith and finds it most unsuitable.</p><p>How can it possibly be that this man who rides along in such poverty and humility should be the King of Jerusalem and that He is riding only a strange, hired ass? How can nature and reason possibly grasp this? How can such an entrance be squared with that of a great King?</p><p>Faith is of such a kind that it does not judge and follow according to what it sees and feels but according to what it hears. It clings to the Word alone. Appearance and outward looks count for nothing at all. Therefore the only ones here who really accepted Christ as a King were those who followed the word of the prophet. They believed in Christ and His kingdom not with their eyes, but accept Him with the spirit.</p><p>These are also the true “daughter of Zion.” For the man who wants to follow Christ according to outward appearance and feeling cannot avoid becoming offended at Him. One must cling firmly to the pure Word alone.</p><p>SL.XI.4,14<br />AE 75,29</p><p><strong>PRAYER:</strong> Enable us at all times, O Lord, to cling with all our faith to your pure Word alone, so that we behold you as you really are and thus ever cling to you in love and obedience, for your truth’s sake. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE FIRST WEEK IN ADVENT – SUNDAY</h3><p><i>LESSON: MATTHEW 21:1-9</i></p><p>Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, and mounted on an ass, and on a colt, the foal of an ass. Matthew 21.5</p><p>This Gospel in a special manner arouses and demands faith. It portrays Christ in His coming grace. No one can really receive and accept Him unless he believes that He is the man in the sense portrayed in this Gospel. All that is set forth here in Christ is pure grace, gentleness and goodness. He who believes this regarding Christ is saved.</p><p>Look at Him! He rides no stallion, an animal mostly associated with war. He does not come in splendor and animal, accustomed to burdens and toil in the service of men. In this way He shows that He comes not to tempt men, nor to come down upon them with force and suppress them, but to them, to bear their burden and to take it upon Himself.</p><p>Although it was the time-honoured custom of the country to ride on asses and to use horses for war, as often recorded in Scripture, all that is narrated here is intended ot make known how this King rides in gently, with nothing but good intent.</p><p>To demonstrate this point, a prophetic statement is introduced here (Zechariah 9.9) to draw us to faith and the acceptance of Christ in a very friendly manner. For the sake of this statement, the events of this Gospel took place and were set down in writing as the evangelist also declares. Let us pay careful attention to this statement and the chief point of this Gospel, for herein Christ is highlighted for us in regard to what we are to hold and believe concerning Him, what we are to expect from Him, what we are to seek in Him, and how we are to avail ourselves of His help and make use of Him.</p><p><strong>PRAYER:</strong> Lord Jesus, fill us at all times with your saving grace. Lead us to true faith and preserve us therein, for your love’s sake. Amen.</p>

      <title>Week of Trinity XXIII - Friday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XXIII - FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+40%3A1-5&version=ESV">PSALM 40:1‒5</a></p><p>Thus says the Lord; “Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his arm, whose heart turns away from the Lord.” Jeremiah 17:5</p><p>The less a man is trained in the ways of the world, the less he is opposed to God. Those who have made progress and gained recognition before the world, deceive and lie more than the others. They think that in the deceitfulness and cunning procedures of their actions, their deceit and vice are covered up. It is true, that they are masters at covering up and hiding their activities! But the Holy Spirit is very keen-sighted, and He knows them very well. Holy Scripture calls such fellows lions, wolves, bears, swine, and wild animals. They are always raging, and they devour and consume everything with their treachery.</p><p>In the Old Testament, the Jews were forbidden to eat certain animals because they were to regard them as unclean. They included those we have just mentioned, as well as others. A possible reason for this was that they were a figure and indication of certain people who are strong, powerful, rich, gifted, learned, prudent, and wise, who are to be strictly avoided as something unclean, namely, as people who mislead and deceive others with their outward brilliance, power, and cleverness. They are people of such a kind, that one would never suspect them of any evil intentions. Hence, we must never put any confidence and trust in any man as such.</p><p>Do not believe anyone. If a man can do so, he will surely mislead you. If you trust him, you will find yourself in opposition to God so that you do not trust God. This is what Jeremiah wants to teach us in the passage cited above.</p><p>SL.XI.1809,16</p><p>PRAYER: As Your children, heavenly Father, we owe all our faith and trust to You alone and not to men, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication. For an alternate English translation of this sermon, see Lenker, Church Postil–Gospels, 5:293-306.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XXIII - FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+40%3A1-5&version=ESV">PSALM 40:1‒5</a></p><p>Thus says the Lord; “Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his arm, whose heart turns away from the Lord.” Jeremiah 17:5</p><p>The less a man is trained in the ways of the world, the less he is opposed to God. Those who have made progress and gained recognition before the world, deceive and lie more than the others. They think that in the deceitfulness and cunning procedures of their actions, their deceit and vice are covered up. It is true, that they are masters at covering up and hiding their activities! But the Holy Spirit is very keen-sighted, and He knows them very well. Holy Scripture calls such fellows lions, wolves, bears, swine, and wild animals. They are always raging, and they devour and consume everything with their treachery.</p><p>In the Old Testament, the Jews were forbidden to eat certain animals because they were to regard them as unclean. They included those we have just mentioned, as well as others. A possible reason for this was that they were a figure and indication of certain people who are strong, powerful, rich, gifted, learned, prudent, and wise, who are to be strictly avoided as something unclean, namely, as people who mislead and deceive others with their outward brilliance, power, and cleverness. They are people of such a kind, that one would never suspect them of any evil intentions. Hence, we must never put any confidence and trust in any man as such.</p><p>Do not believe anyone. If a man can do so, he will surely mislead you. If you trust him, you will find yourself in opposition to God so that you do not trust God. This is what Jeremiah wants to teach us in the passage cited above.</p><p>SL.XI.1809,16</p><p>PRAYER: As Your children, heavenly Father, we owe all our faith and trust to You alone and not to men, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XXIII - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+106%3A6-8&version=ESV">PSALM 106:6‒8</a></p><p>For consider your call, brethren; not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth; but God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong, God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. 1 Corinthians 1:26‒29</p><p>In this week’s Gospel (Matthew 22:15‒22), we have a very good portrayal of the cunning and perversity of human nature. There is nothing in men by nature but evil, lies, deceit, cunning, and all that is vicious. By nature man is nothing else but a liar, as the psalmist declares. You cannot trust a single person. Don’t think for a moment that you will ever hear a word of truth from anyone; man is a liar whenever he opens his mouth. How so? The spring is evil, that is, the heart is no good. Therefore the streams are no good either.</p><p>This is why the Lord at times described men as a “brood of vipers” (Matthew 12:34) and “serpents” (Matthew 23:33). Is not this an apt title for these people? Let anyone come forward here to boast about his piety and the powers of his own free will! Before the world it is possible to put on a fine exterior, and to be pious and holy, with much outward glitter. But there is really nothing else there than a brood of vipers and serpents, especially in the most valued, excellent, wise, and clever men. When you read the histories of the Greeks, Romans, and Jews, you will find that the best and cleverest princes, those who ruled well by human standards, were not conscious of receiving anything from God but relied on themselves alone, ascribing nothing at all to the power of God.</p><p>SL.XI.1809,15</p><p>PRAYER: Dear Lord, heavenly Father, in Your mercy and grace You bestow upon us everything in our lives that deserves to be called good. May we ever cling to You in firm faith, the giver of all good gifts, in Christ our Lord. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

We are treated as impostors, and yet are true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold we live; as punished, and yet not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing everything. 2 Corinthians 6:3‒10</p><p>Nothing better can happen for the Gospel than for the world to oppose it with might and cunning.

Let no one therefore be afraid, even if all the cleverness and might of the world range themselves against the Gospel, and even if efforts are made to subdue it with bloodshed.

The more the wisdom of the world opposes the truth of the Gospel, the purer and clearer the truth becomes.</p><p>SL.XI.1807,10‒11</p><p>PRAYER: Be the defender and protector of Your Word and Gospel, O God, in all attacks made on it by its enemies. May Your Word and Gospel continue to go from strength to strength, in and through our Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

Against the Holy Spirit no human counsel is of any avail. Through Christ we have the power to tread sin underfoot and to trample upon death, and a wisdom that exceeds the wisdom of the whole world.

But when they set themselves to overthrow the Gospel, it is quite certain that they will fail in a disgraceful manner, and they themselves will be caught in the trap by which they hoped to overthrow the Gospel.

But if we are to continue our life here on earth, it must not be directed towards gaining God’s favor by our works.</p><p>Anyone who holds such a view makes a mockery of God and blasphemes God. Yet this is what was taught for such a long time in the Church. We were informed that we must keep on pestering God with our good works, prayers, fasts, and the like, until we obtained His grace.

But He wants you to do works as fruits of faith, to demonstrate the reality of your faith before the whole world in works.</p><p>This servant (Matthew 18:23‒35) is an example or a picture of all who should serve their neighbor in faith. But what does he do? He does what most of us do. We imagine that we have faith, and in part this is true. We rejoice at having heard the Gospel, and we may even be able to talk a great deal about it.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XXII - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROMANS+4%3A9-12&version=ESV">ROMANS 4:9‒12</a></p><p>If it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace. Romans 11:6</p><p>In his mercy, the lord in the parable of Matthew 18:23‒35 pities the wretched situation of the servant before him. He sets aside and gives up his rights and says no more about selling his servant “with his wife and children and all that he had.” He could certainly have insisted on his rights, declaring, “You have to pay up; I have my rights and have no intention of giving them up for your sake.” No one could have found fault with him on this score.</p><p>But he does not want to deal with his servant on the basis of rights. He exchanges rights for grace and has pity on his servant. He sets him free, together with his wife and children and all that he has, and forgives him his whole debt. This is also what God proclaims through the Gospel, saying to us, “He who believes shall not only have his debt forgiven but also the punishment he has merited.”</p><p>Works must never come into consideration here. Anyone who suggests that one can get rid of the guilt and punishment for sin through works has denied the Gospel. That God should have pity on you and that you should earn or merit His favor cannot be harmonized in any way. Paul’s argument is unanswerable, “If it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace” (Romans 11:6). If you pay what you owe, there is no need for His mercy. If you are the recipient of His mercy, you are not paying for it. Hence we must allow Him to initiate His dealings with us and to act quite alone; we must receive from Him and believe in Him. That is what the Gospel is all about, as we see also from this parable.</p><p>SL.XI.1794,16<br />AE. 79:255-265</p><p>PRAYER: As lost and condemned sinners, without any righteousness or merits of our own, O God, we have no other recourse but to throw ourselves on Your mercy and love. It is the glory of Your Gospel that it assures us that Your grace alone is our effective means of salvation, in and through Christ our Savior. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XXII - WEDNESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=HEBREWS+9%3A11-14&version=ESV">HEBREWS 9:11‒14</a></p><p>“Out of pity for him, the lord of that servant released him and forgave him the debt.” Matthew 18:27</p><p>The lord has pity on this servant in his wretched condition. The servant is securely caught and entangled in his sins and foolish enough to suppose that he can help himself out of his hopeless plight. He does not look for mercy. He knows nothing about grace. He feels nothing but his sins which oppress him sorely. There is no one to whom he can turn for help. Even while he is in this wretched plight, the lord turned to him in pity and released him.</p><p>In this action of the lord, there is portrayed to us what the Gospel in its nature really is, and how God deals with us. If you are entangled in your sins and are afraid that you can find no help to rescue you from your sad plight, the Gospel comes to you and says, “No, not so, my dear friend, it does not help you to martyr yourself to the point of distraction and to become alarmed. It is not your works but God’s mercy alone which moves Him to have pity on you in your wretched situation. He sees that you are in the grip of fear, that you are throttling yourself in the mire of your sins, that you cannot extricate yourself from your plight. He can see that you cannot pay your debt. In pity and mercy, He forgives you your whole debt. Therefore, it is a case of pure mercy. He forgives you your debt, not because of your works or any merits. He has pity on your cries, entreaties, and the requests you have made on your knees.”</p><p>This means that God regards a humble heart, as David declares, “The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise” (Psalm 51:17). A heart that is broken, he says, and contrite, that cannot help itself and is quite content to have God reach out a helping hand to it, is the most acceptable sacrifice before God and the right way to heaven.</p><p>SL.XI.1793,14‒15<br />AE. 79:255-265</p><p>PRAYER: Eternal praise and thanks be Yours, heavenly Father, for Your mercy and grace and the rescue from all sins available to us in Your Gospel of salvation, as revealed to us in and through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

I forgave you all that debt because you besought me; and should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?’” Matthew 18:32‒33</p><p>In the Gospel, there is nothing but sheer forgiveness. The lord of the servant forgave him his whole debt, and the lord expected that servant to forgive his fellow servant and release him from his debt. This is how God wants matters to stand in His kingdom. No one should ever be so displeased with his neighbor or angry with him that he cannot forgive his neighbor. </p><p>As Christ points out in the context immediately preceding, even if your neighbor incurs your anger not just seven times “but seventy times seven” (Matthew 18:22), that is, as often as it would be possible to do so, you should drop your rights and feel remit him everything. Why? Because Christ has also done this for you. </p><p>He has initiated and set up a kingdom in which there is nothing but pure grace, a kingdom which will never end, in which everything will be forgiven you as often as you have sinned. He has sent out His Gospel which proclaims not punishment but pure grace alone. As long as this regime stands, you can always rise again, no matter how deeply and how often you have fallen away from it. </p><p>One thing Christ expects of you, that you forgive your neighbor the sins he has committed against you. Otherwise you cannot hold your place in His kingdom of grace or enjoy the good news that your sins are forgiven you. This, in brief, is the gist and meaning of this Gospel.</p><p><br />SL.XI.1789,6 <br />AE: 79:255-265</p><p>PRAYER: We thank You from the bottom of our hearts, O God, for the full and often repeated forgiveness of our sins which we enjoy in Your kingdom of grace.

Romans 13:3</p><p>The Gospel, or the kingdom of God, is nothing else but the estate or regime in which there is nothing but the forgiveness of sins. Where there is a regime in which sins are not forgiven, there is no Gospel or kingdom of God. Therefore, the two kingdoms must be kept clearly apart: the one in which sin is punished, the other in which sin is forgiven; the one in which rights are demanded, the other in which rights are given up.

      <title>Week of Trinity XXI - Saturday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XXI - SATURDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+103%3A13-22&version=ESV">PSALM 103:13‒22</a></p><p>We rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not disappoint us, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been given to us. Romans 5:3‒5</p><p>Faith exercises itself in trials and temptations, and every day brings new trials. Experience does not repeat itself so often, as we see also in this Gospel (John 4:47‒54). The way in which this official set his faith working is past. These particular circumstances will not crop up again, but there will be other trials. If the same temptations present themselves, it should, of course, be easier to cope with them. The more victories one has, the more firmly one takes hold of Christ and becomes skilled in bearing everything that Christ chooses to lay upon one.</p><p>In this Gospel, you have received an example of an increasing faith. It is clear enough; take it to heart! Each Christian will always be given opportunities to practice his faith. He can also trust that God will always help him. In this way, he will have the experience of God’s help to lead him on to greater faith.</p><p>There is always something new cropping up so that we may see and grasp that our Lord God is true. If we have the trust and confidence that He will nourish and preserve our body, we can also believe that He will save our souls.</p><p>SL.XI.1770,20‒22<br />AE. 79:225-232</p><p>PRAYER: You are our loving heavenly Father, O God. As such, you can never forget the needs of Your children. Grant us ever stronger faith, tested and proved in trials and temptations, for the sake of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XXI - SATURDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+103%3A13-22&version=ESV">PSALM 103:13‒22</a></p><p>We rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not disappoint us, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been given to us. Romans 5:3‒5</p><p>Faith exercises itself in trials and temptations, and every day brings new trials. Experience does not repeat itself so often, as we see also in this Gospel (John 4:47‒54). The way in which this official set his faith working is past. These particular circumstances will not crop up again, but there will be other trials. If the same temptations present themselves, it should, of course, be easier to cope with them. The more victories one has, the more firmly one takes hold of Christ and becomes skilled in bearing everything that Christ chooses to lay upon one.</p><p>In this Gospel, you have received an example of an increasing faith. It is clear enough; take it to heart! Each Christian will always be given opportunities to practice his faith. He can also trust that God will always help him. In this way, he will have the experience of God’s help to lead him on to greater faith.</p><p>There is always something new cropping up so that we may see and grasp that our Lord God is true. If we have the trust and confidence that He will nourish and preserve our body, we can also believe that He will save our souls.</p><p>SL.XI.1770,20‒22<br />AE. 79:225-232</p><p>PRAYER: You are our loving heavenly Father, O God. As such, you can never forget the needs of Your children. Grant us ever stronger faith, tested and proved in trials and temptations, for the sake of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XXI - FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=COLOSSIANS+1%3A9-14&version=ESV">COLOSSIANS 1:9‒14</a></p><p>The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way. . . . He himself believed and all his household. John 4:50, 53</p><p>We must always keep ourselves in trim so that we do not just remain at the one fixed level but continually increase. Hence there must be a cross, temptation, and tribulation in which faith can grow and become strong. Even as clarity of faith increases, so also there is progress in the disciplining of the body. The stronger faith becomes, the weaker the flesh becomes. The smaller our faith, the stronger our flesh becomes, and the less success we have in putting it off.</p><p>We are inclined to think, “If I am to be always helping my neighbor, what is going to become of me? I shall be going to him for something in the end.” If we had a correct faith, one which reflects Christ in us, we would not be doubtful about having enough, but would declare in all confidence, “God will provide for us in every need.” If we give up at every little puff, how shall we face up to something really big?</p><p>Faith must be practiced to increase. Simply to go on and always remain every day what we were yesterday, and tomorrow what we are today, is not a Christian life. In this Gospel, John takes special care to point out how this royal official increased in faith.</p><p>What did he believe after he came to his house? Not that his son had recovered and been restored to him. He could see his living son before his eyes. From the way in which he had experienced Christ’s help, he now also believed that Christ would help him in any other troubles that would cross his path.</p><p>SL.XI.1768,17,19<br />AE. 79:225-232</p><p>PRAYER: Increase our faith, Lord Jesus, by removing all doubt and uncertainty from our hearts, filling them with the certainty and confidence of faith, for Your name’s sake.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XXI - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=LUKE+11%3A5-13&version=ESV">LUKE 11:5‒13</a></p><p>“Go; your son will live.” John 4:50</p><p>In the matter of faith, one must let everything go and cling to the Word alone. When we have gripped that, let the world, death, sin, hell, and every misfortune storm and rage.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XXI - MONDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROMANS+4%3A13-25&version=ESV">ROMANS 4:13‒25</a></p><p>At Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill. When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. John 4:46‒47</p><p>Scripture teaches that there must be increase and progress in faith. It is quite true that you have Christ by faith, even if your treasure is wrapped only in a poor piece of cloth. But you must still make an effort to retain it and not lose it.</p><p>This royal official, whoever he was (I think he was a servant of King Herod), had advanced so far in his faith that he believed that if only he could persuade Jesus to come to his house, his son would certainly receive all the help he needed. He had heard the Gospel concerning Christ, namely, that he was ready to help everyone who was brought to Him and refused His goodness to no one. This good news his faith grasped; it compelled him to go to Jesus. If he had felt in his heart that no one could really be certain that Jesus would help him, he would not have come to Him. It is quite certain that prior to this he had made up his mind and firmly believed that Jesus would help him.</p><p>It is the nature and character of faith to build up a picture in a man’s heart which reflects the goodness of Christ. The write of Hebrews says that “faith is the assurance of things hoped for” (Hebrews 11:1), that is, of good things hoped for from God. The faith of this man is of such a kind that if he had continued in it he would certainly have been saved thereby. The Lord was certainly pleased with this man’s faith.</p><p>SL.XI.1764,6‒7<br />AE. 79:225-232</p><p>PRAYER: Heavenly Father, You have given us countless examples of the riches of Your goodness toward us in Your holy Word and especially in Your Gospel. Grant us at all times steadfastness of faith and trust, that we may always believe Your promises and assurances with our whole hearts, in and through our Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XX - SATURDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ACTS+5%3A1-11&version=ESV">ACTS 5:1‒11</a></p><p>“Everything is ready; come to the marriage feast.” Matthew 22:4</p><p>“Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment? Matthew 22:12</p><p>In order to provide guests for the marriage feast, the king’s servants must never cease to continue with their proclamation, inviting all whom they meet to come to the marriage feast. The king wants a full table at this feast. The most important, holy, and mighty people who were invited first would not come. As Luke tells the parable, the king then sent out his servants to invite “the poor and maimed and blind and lame” (Luke 14:21).

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XX - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PHILIPPIANS+4%3A4-7&version=ESV">PHILIPPIANS 4:4‒7</a></p><p>“Your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.” John 16:22</p><p>We must learn to accept and to believe the Word. Christ Himself proclaims this Word to us, and God has commanded us to believe it as the truth. To reject this Word is tantamount to calling Christ a liar. We must learn to believe and trust the Word despite what our feelings may be inclined to suggest to us.</p><p>If you are to believe the Word, you cannot cling to what your own thoughts or feelings may suggest. You must cling to God’s Word, no matter how little you actually feel or experience it. If you are a person who realizes his need and wretchedness, and have a hearty desire to participate in the consolation and love of Christ, give your ears and heart to Christ. Take hold of the comforting picture presented in the Gospel (Matthew 22:1‒14), in which He shows that He wants you to acknowledge Him and believe in Him. You can be sure, He has an even deeper love and concern for you than any earthly bridegroom has for his beloved bride. On the other hand, He expects such a heartfelt confidence and joy from you towards Himself that it exceeds that of any bride for her bridegroom.</p><p>We could all probably find any amount of cause here to reprehend our unbelief and declare, “If such warm, heartfelt confidence and joy can be found between a bride and bridegroom, after all a rather insignificant and transient matter, why do I not find greater joy in my godly and faithful Savior Christ, who gave Himself for me as my very own possession? What a wretched thing this unbelief is! It keeps my heart from being full of laughter and eternal joy.”</p><p>SL.XI.1752,13<br />AE. 79:213-223</p><p>PRAYER: Lord, remove from us all diffidence, lukewarmness, and unbelief, and confirm us in the full joy of salvation, which is always ours in and through our Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

We must learn to believe and trust the Word despite what our feelings may be inclined to suggest to us.</p><p>If you are to believe the Word, you cannot cling to what your own thoughts or feelings may suggest. You must cling to God’s Word, no matter how little you actually feel or experience it. If you are a person who realizes his need and wretchedness, and have a hearty desire to participate in the consolation and love of Christ, give your ears and heart to Christ. Take hold of the comforting picture presented in the Gospel (Matthew 22:1‒14), in which He shows that He wants you to acknowledge Him and believe in Him. You can be sure, He has an even deeper love and concern for you than any earthly bridegroom has for his beloved bride. On the other hand, He expects such a heartfelt confidence and joy from you towards Himself that it exceeds that of any bride for her bridegroom.</p><p>We could all probably find any amount of cause here to reprehend our unbelief and declare, “If such warm, heartfelt confidence and joy can be found between a bride and bridegroom, after all a rather insignificant and transient matter, why do I not find greater joy in my godly and faithful Savior Christ, who gave Himself for me as my very own possession? What a wretched thing this unbelief is! It keeps my heart from being full of laughter and eternal joy.”</p><p>SL.XI.1752,13<br />AE. 79:213-223</p><p>PRAYER: Lord, remove from us all diffidence, lukewarmness, and unbelief, and confirm us in the full joy of salvation, which is always ours in and through our Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XX - WEDNESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW+19%3A1-6&version=ESV">MATTHEW 19:1‒6</a></p><p>Husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no man ever hates his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, as Christ does the church, because we are members of His body. Ephesians 5:28‒30</p><p>The love of a man and woman in marriage is a parable or a picture of the great, hidden, but wonderful union of Christ with His Church. All believers are members of that Church, and, as St. Paul says, they are members of Christ’s body (Ephesians 5:30), of His flesh and bones, as in the beginning, at the creation, the woman was taken from the man.</p><p>What a great, unfathomable, and unspeakable love God must have for us for the divine nature thus to become united with us and merged with our flesh and blood, for God’s Son truly to become one flesh and one body with us and to receive us into such a lofty status! He is not merely content to become our brother; He also becomes our bridegroom, turns to us and gives us as our very own possession all His divine blessings, wisdom, righteousness, life, strength, and power. Yes, we are even destined to become “partakers of the divine nature,” as St. Peter declares (2 Peter 1:4). All this He wants us to believe.</p><p>We have had this great honor and many blessings conferred upon us so that we should joyfully and in all confidence take comfort in this Lord like a bride in her bridegroom’s property and honor. Christ’s Christendom is, therefore, wife and queen in heaven and on earth; for she is called the bride of God who is Lord of all the creatures. In the highest manner possible, He gives authority and power over sin, death, the devil, and hell.</p><p>SL.XI.1750,8<br />AE. 79:213-223</p><p>PRAYER: Thanks and praise be Yours, O Lord, for the wonderful love You have shown to us and bestowed upon us in the gift of Your Son.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XIX - SATURDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+32%3A1-5&version=ESV">PSALM 32:1‒5</a></p><p>“Why do you think evil in your hearts? For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise and walk’? But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—He then said to the paralytic—“Rise, take up your bed and go home.” And he rose and went home. When the crowds saw it, they were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men. Matthew 9:4‒8</p><p>If there were no human being on earth who could forgive us our sins, and there were only laws and works, what a feeble, wretched thing our poor, afflicted conscience would be! But now that God has filled every mouth so that it can say to its neighbor, “Your sins are forgiven you, no matter where you may be,” a real jubilee year has dawned for all men.</p><p>As a result of this, we should adopt a bold stance over against sin. When we encounter a brother who is in fear and trembling because of his sins, we should tell the poor man quite confidently: “Be joyful and assured, my brother, your sins are forgiven you! Although I cannot give you the Holy Spirit and faith, I can nevertheless proclaim them to you. If you believe, you will receive.” And those to whom Christ gives the Holy Spirit and faith, thank and praise God as the people did in the Gospel (Matthew 9:1‒8).</p><p>This also means that God has given man the power and authority to forgive sins. This is extending the kingdom of Christ, healing and establishing a troubled conscience. We do this through the Word. God grant that we may grasp it in this way.</p><p>SL.XI.1723,31</p><p>PRAYER: Blessed indeed are we, heavenly Father, in the knowledge and assurance of the forgiveness of sins. Let us never underrate this glorious message, even when it is proclaimed to us by one of our brethren, in and through Christ our Savior. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XIX - FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+130&version=ESV">PSALM 130</a></p><p>And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.” John 20:22‒23</p><p>The Pharisees knew quite well that it was God’s work alone to forgive sins. They regarded Christ as a blasphemer because He whom they regarded as nothing more than a man presumed to forgive sins.</p><p>Sin is forgiven in two ways. First, sin is driven out of the heart and grace is poured in. This God alone can do. Secondly, the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed. This one man can do for another man.</p><p>Christ here does both. He gives the paralytic the forgiveness of sins inwardly in his heart, and He proclaims the forgiveness of his sins outwardly to him by means of His Word. This is the forgiveness of sins by means of the Word and the proclamation and public preaching of this internal forgiveness.</p><p>This power belongs to all who are baptized Christians. Hereby they praise Christ and carry the Word of the forgiveness of sins in their mouth so that they can and may say whenever they so desire and as often as it is necessary, “Take heart; your sins are forgiven! Believe it; be quite sure of it!” and whatever other words they choose to use.</p><p>This proclamation will not cease among Christians until the last day: Your sins are forgiven you; take heart and be assured!” These words a Christian always has in his mouth, and he openly proclaims the Word in which sins are forgiven. In this way, every Christian has power and authority to forgive sins.</p><p>SL.XI.1722,28‒29</p><p>PRAYER: We bless and praise You, O Lord, for the wonderful privilege You have conferred on us as Your children, to announce the full and free forgiveness of sins to sinners.

I must eat and drink, adorn and clothe myself, not merely to preserve my life but to spread the Word. Wherever the best interests of God’s Word are not the determining factor in a Christian’s life, that life is not as it should be. I must help men in regard to their conscience according to the Word.

Whether you are man, woman, or child, you should know that Christ gives you His Gospel and brings you into His kingdom so that you should make it the one aim of your whole life to help others, the sick and the needy, in the hope of bringing them also into Christ’s kingdom or confirming them in their Christian faith.</p><p>SL.XI.1719,22‒23</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, heavenly Father, it is Your will that we should readily help our fellowmen in every need and wherever possible make Your wonderful goodness known to them through us.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XIX - WEDNESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+103%3A1-13&version=ESV">PSALM 103:1‒13</a></p><p>“I, I am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake, and I will not remember your sins.” Isaiah 43:25</p><p>The forgiveness of sins is a very short phrase, but it comprises the whole kingdom of Christ. Men always have sins, but they must be recognized and acknowledged. When I have recognized them, forgiveness and grace are readily available. Before forgiveness enters the picture, there is absolutely nothing but sin. I am compelled to acknowledge this. I feel and know that all that is in me is blindness. Without this acknowledgment, the forgiveness of sins will not hold its ground. We never fall short in the matter of sins, but we do fall short in our acknowledgment of sins. The forgiveness of sins follows the acknowledgment of sins.</p><p>There is, however, quite a difference between God’s forgiveness of our sins and our forgiveness of our neighbor’s sins. When we forgive our neighbor, we may recall that sin again subsequently and throw it in our neighbor’s face. When God forgives us our sin it is something much higher. God no longer condemns us; He abandons all His wrath. Indeed, He never thinks of our sins again as He reminds us in this text from Isaiah.</p><p>And having abandoned His wrath, He also removes hell, the devil, death, and every misfortune which the devil may bring along. Instead of wrath He gives us grace, consolation, salvation, and every good thing that He Himself is.</p><p>SL.XL.1715,12</p><p>PRAYER: There is always forgiveness with You, O God, as You assure us times without number in Your holy Word.

      <title>Week of Trinity XIX - Tuesday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XIX - TUESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=LUKE+12%3A32-34&version=ESV">LUKE 12:32‒34</a></p><p>To them [His saints] God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. Colossians 1:27</p><p>The kingdom of Christ is of such a kind that we waive all our glorying and boldness in our dependence on God’s grace. All other works are free. We must never make them matters of any compulsion. Nor must we imagine that we can become Christians from our works, but with our works we reach down and serve the interests of our neighbor. Hence we should listen carefully to what this week’s Gospel (Matthew 9:1‒8) has to tell us, and take a firm grasp of its statements and impress them on our hearts so that this light, these words and this lamp, may shine forth brightly in us, that thereby we may instruct others.</p><p>Jesus says to the paralytic, “Your sins are forgiven.” We should take hold of these and similar words and grasp them with our hearts, because they are words of pure grace alone. There is nothing of any work here, suggesting that a conscience should be forced to attempt to do something meritorious. And so you must fortify yourself with these words against false prophets.</p><p>We have planted the Word to a certain extent. This the devil cannot abide. He never sleeps. The caterpillars and the beetles will come to defile what we have planted. And so it must be. For Christ wants to prove His Word, to carry out a test to see who has grasped it or not. Let us, then, remain on the correct path which leads to the kingdom of Christ, not operating with works and legal pressures and compulsion, but with the words of the Gospel alone, “Be joyful, take heart, your sins are forgiven.”</p><p>SL.XI.1714,9‒10</p><p>PRAYER: Heavenly Father, we poor sinners are blessed, indeed, in the assurance of the forgiveness of sins which You have emphasized so much for us in Your Gospel of salvation. Give us a faith which always clings wholly and solely to the forgiveness of sins where You have provided it for us, in and through Jesus Christ. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XIX - TUESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=LUKE+12%3A32-34&version=ESV">LUKE 12:32‒34</a></p><p>To them [His saints] God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. Colossians 1:27</p><p>The kingdom of Christ is of such a kind that we waive all our glorying and boldness in our dependence on God’s grace. All other works are free. We must never make them matters of any compulsion. Nor must we imagine that we can become Christians from our works, but with our works we reach down and serve the interests of our neighbor. Hence we should listen carefully to what this week’s Gospel (Matthew 9:1‒8) has to tell us, and take a firm grasp of its statements and impress them on our hearts so that this light, these words and this lamp, may shine forth brightly in us, that thereby we may instruct others.</p><p>Jesus says to the paralytic, “Your sins are forgiven.” We should take hold of these and similar words and grasp them with our hearts, because they are words of pure grace alone. There is nothing of any work here, suggesting that a conscience should be forced to attempt to do something meritorious. And so you must fortify yourself with these words against false prophets.</p><p>We have planted the Word to a certain extent. This the devil cannot abide. He never sleeps. The caterpillars and the beetles will come to defile what we have planted. And so it must be. For Christ wants to prove His Word, to carry out a test to see who has grasped it or not. Let us, then, remain on the correct path which leads to the kingdom of Christ, not operating with works and legal pressures and compulsion, but with the words of the Gospel alone, “Be joyful, take heart, your sins are forgiven.”</p><p>SL.XI.1714,9‒10</p><p>PRAYER: Heavenly Father, we poor sinners are blessed, indeed, in the assurance of the forgiveness of sins which You have emphasized so much for us in Your Gospel of salvation. Give us a faith which always clings wholly and solely to the forgiveness of sins where You have provided it for us, in and through Jesus Christ. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication. For an alternate English translation of this sermon, see Lenker, Church Postil–Gospels, 5:196-210.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XIX - MONDAY</p><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=COLOSSIANS+2%3A13-19&version=ESV">COLOSSIANS 2:13‒19</a></p><p>It is the God who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ. 2 Corinthians 4:6</p><p>If the kingdom of Christ is to be extended, you must not bring the Law into your calculations or have any truck with works. It is quite out of character to say to men, “Go out and run here and there to atone for your sins; you must hold this and do that if you want to get rid of your sins.” In diametrical opposition to anything in the shape of law and all works, we must assure men that their sins are forgiven by pure grace alone. To try to force them into the kingdom of Christ by the Law is putting yourself outside of this kingdom.</p><p>It is true that this truth may reach our ears and even roll off our tongues, but only too often it has not really penetrated our hearts. Sin always clings to us very closely (Hebrews 12:1) so that we are compelled to confess with Paul, “I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will what is right, but I cannot do it. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do” (Romans 7:18‒19). This is how it will be until at death we pass into life eternal. </p><p>Because there is always so much weakness, failure, and sin among Christians, it is often claimed by radicals and enthusiasts that faith and love are not enough. They insist on more radical procedures and decisions, and often claim the special patronage of the Holy Spirit in this connection. The devil’s weeds always accompany any planting of the Gospel. See to it that you always retain and maintain a healthy understanding of Christ’s kingdom and its teachings.</p><p>SL.XI.1712,4‒5</p><p>PRAYER: We are deeply conscious, heavenly Father, of our sinfulness and unworthiness, and in this respect must ever stand as beggars before You. But we have been emboldened by the assurances of Your Gospel of salvation to approach Your throne of grace in all confidence and assurance.

It is the kingdom in which our hearts are touched by a sweet voice bringing us maternal and paternal words, “Your sins are forgiven.” For a correct understanding, we must not regard the kingdom of Christ otherwise than the way in which we should live in relation to God. In this connection, you in your love will know that the most important thing is to be able to quieten the troubled conscience so that we know how we stand with God and our neighbor.</p><p>The kingdom of Christ, then, is a kingdom in which there is consolation pure and simple, and the forgiveness of sins. It is not just a matter of words proclaimed to us setting forth future blessings, but of realized facts, as we see from the example set before us in this Gospel.

We know only too well how reason in all respects is inclined to fall away from faith and the correct knowledge of Christ’s kingdom to reliance on works. But in this Gospel you see no works at all, no merit. There is no question here of any commandment or law. There is nothing else here than the offer of Christ’s help, His consolation and grace. The paralytic experiences nothing but Christ’s sheer friendship.</p><p>SL.XI.1712,2‒3</p><p>PRAYER: Gracious and merciful Father, You have given us many comforting and assuring consolations in Your Gospel, and none more comforting than the assurance of the forgiveness of our sins. May we never reject these assurances or belittle them in any way, but ever cling to them, in and through our Savior Jesus Christ.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XVIII - FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROMANS+8%3A1-11&version=ESV">ROMANS 8:1‒11</a></p><p>There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death. Romans 8:1‒2</p><p>Christ wants to show us in this week’s Gospel (Matthew 22:34‒36) that the Law is preached correctly only when we learn from it that we cannot fulfill it, and that on the basis of the Law we are really the devil’s own children. Experience teaches us this, and it is also indicated in various parts of Holy Scripture, especially in the epistles of Paul. Paul says in Romans, “The mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s law, indeed it cannot; and those who are in the flesh cannot please God” (Romans 8:7‒8).</p><p>So consider this commandment in the Gospel very carefully, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart.” Concentrate on this commandment and really make a serious effort to keep it. Do some searching here! Study the nature of the commandment! You will find, or course, that you are far from fulfilling it, that is, from accepting with your whole heart what God wants from you on the basis of this commandment.</p><p>It is sheer hypocrisy for anyone to crawl away into some corner and think, “I will love God,” or “O how I love God, my Father! How well disposed I am to Him!” and similar self-congratulations. It is not difficult for us to fulfill the Law on our own terms, especially if we can persuade ourselves that we enjoy His favor. But when misfortune intervenes and opposition is encountered, it can be a very different story. Then we soon lose sight of God as our loving Father.</p><p>SL.XI.1694,22</p><p>PRAYER: We thank and praise You, heavenly Father, for the victory over all sin, including all our sins against Your holy Law, which You have provided for us in and through our Savior Jesus Christ, in whose name we pray. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

How well disposed I am to Him!” and similar self-congratulations. It is not difficult for us to fulfill the Law on our own terms, especially if we can persuade ourselves that we enjoy His favor. But when misfortune intervenes and opposition is encountered, it can be a very different story. Then we soon lose sight of God as our loving Father.</p><p>SL.XI.1694,22</p><p>PRAYER: We thank and praise You, heavenly Father, for the victory over all sin, including all our sins against Your holy Law, which You have provided for us in and through our Savior Jesus Christ, in whose name we pray. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XVIII - MONDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+SAMUEL+16%3A1-7&version=ESV">1 SAMUEL 16:1-7</a></p><p>“You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it, you shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.” Matthew 22:37-40</p><p>Jesus means to say here: He who has kept these two commandments dealing with the love of God and the love of one's neighbor, has everything, and he has also fulfilled the Law. For the whole Law and the prophets concentrate on these two issues, namely, how one should love God and how one should love one's neighbor.</p><p>There may be those who feel inclined to wonder how everything depends on these two commandments when people like the Jews were given circumcision and many other laws which cannot so easily be related to these two chief commandments. In replying, we should note first of all how Christ explains obedience to the Law. He says that we must obey it from the heart.</p><p>For Christ, obedience to the Law is something spiritual. He who does not obey the Law from his heart and tackle it with his spirit, will never fulfil it. Hence the Lord here sets before the lawyers the basis and kernel of the Law, saying that the chief commandment of the Law is to love God from the heart and one's neighbor as oneself.</p><p>It follows from this that anyone who does not keep the Law from the heart is not really circumcised, does not fast and does not pray, even if he does perform such acts externally. External performances without obedience of the heart are nothing before God. God looks at the heart and not merely at the external work or appearance. It does not help a man to perform any number of works if his heart is not engaged thereby.</p><p>SL.XI.1687,4-5</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, heavenly Father, grant your people grace to serve you with pure hearts and minds in obedience to your holy Law, and with firm confidence in your Gospel, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XVIII - SUNDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW+22%3A34-46&version=ESV">MATTHEW 22:34-46</a></p><p>“Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.” Psalm 119:18</p><p>Today's Gospel supplies answers to two questions. The first is the one which the lawyer puts to Jesus on behalf of the Pharisees, "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?" The second is the question which the Lord Himself puts to the Pharisees and scribes, "What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?"</p><p>These two questions also concern us Christians. For anyone who wants to be a Christian must be well-informed in these two respects: first, what the Law is and what is its function; secondly, who Christ is and what he should expect from Him.</p><p>Christ here interprets the Law for the Pharisees and points out to them what is its sum. He answers in such a way that they are effectively silenced by His replies, and finish up knowing quite precisely what the Law is and what Christ is.</p><p>From this it follows that where unbelief is, although it has the appearance of wisdom and holiness before the world, it nevertheless remains folly and unrighteousness before God, especially where there is no knowledge of the two questions being discussed here. For he who does not know what the function of the Law really is, and what he should expect from Christ, certainly knows nothing of the true wisdom of God, no matter how wise or clever he may be.</p><p>SL.XI.1686,1-2</p><p>PRAYER: O God, our heavenly Father, make your holy will known to us with such clarity on the basis of your holy Law that we may cling ever more firmly to our Savior, who has fulfilled this law for us. We ask this in the name and for the sake of Jesus our Savior. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XVII - SATURDAY</p><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW+20%3A20-28&version=ESV">MATTHEW 20:20‒28</a></p><p>“The tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.” Luke 18:13‒14</p><p>St. Augustine adds a gloss at this point.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XVII - FRIDAY</p><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+138%3A1-6&version=ESV">PSALM 138:1‒6</a></p><p>“When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, do not sit down in a place of honor, lest a more eminent man than you be invited by him; and he who invited you both will come and say to you, “Give place to this man,” and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place. But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, ‘Friend, go up higher’; then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you.” Luke 14:8‒10</p><p>This is an illustration for all of us; we must all heed the instruction given here, whether we are high or lowly. Jesus reproaches the Pharisees and the bigwigs who want to sit at the top and are prepared to trample over others to get there. Such people are always looking for places of honor. When such a place is offered us by someone with authority to offer it to us, we can accept it. Even so, there is never any excuse for trampling over others to get there.</p><p>There are those, however, who think it possible to combine the spiritual and earthly realms and that therefore it is enough to be humble in heart and still make for the place of honor. True humility of heart must express itself in outward works, otherwise it is a feigned humility. Each of us should always go and sit in the lowest place. We should throw ourselves at the feet of others rather than try to force our way to the top, unless we are forced by circumstances beyond our control to accept such a seat of honor. If we follow this course, all will be well with us. If we do not learn this lesson, we shall ultimately be put to shame.</p><p>SL 11:1684 (25‒26)<br />AE 79:154‒161</p><p>PRAYER: Lord Jesus Christ, by precept and example You have taught us that in Your kingdom the greatest of all is always the servant of all, and that the humble shall be exalted. Make us content to take with gladness the lowest place and, if it pleases You to call us higher, preserve within us a simple and humble heart, to Your glory and honor. Amen.</p>

Are you not quite mad and foolish? You do this for an ox or an ass, worth perhaps a few florins; much more should you be prepared to do it for your neighbor when he has need of your help, regardless of whether it happens to be a Sabbath day.” For the Sabbath, as He points out elsewhere, was made for man and not man for the Sabbath. Hence, the Son of Man is lord also of the Sabbath (Mark 2:27‒28).</p><p>Laws like the Sabbath laws received great emphasis among the Jews; their kings also laid great stress on them. They had to be strictly kept. When the prophets appeared and tried to interpret the Law in accordance with love, insisting that this is also how Moses meant the Law to be understood, there were false prophets at the royal courts who stuck fast to the text, claiming, “There it stands written; it is God’s Word, and it dare not be interpreted otherwise.” No matter how loudly the prophets insisted on the correct understanding, they encountered nothing but deafened ears. Not only this, but the kings, poor blind men that they were, started up and killed one prophet after the other.</p><p>Ecclesiastical authorities follow much the same procedure even today. If one tells such people that we are not obliged to obey all their laws but only those slanted towards love, they immediately cry out, “Heretic, heretic!” And if they can do so, they put such a heretic to death, as they have already done quite extensively.</p><p>SL 11:1680 (15‒16)<br />AE 79:154‒161</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, heavenly Father, You have shown us extensively in Your Word, but more especially in Your Gospel of salvation, that with You love is always everything. Implant Your love in our hearts that we may live by it in our lives, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. </p>

      <title>Week of Trinity XVII - Wednesday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XVII - WEDNESDAY</p><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+CORINTHIANS+13%3A1-3&version=ESV">1 CORINTHIANS 13:1‒13</a></p><p>Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. 1 Corinthians 13:7</p><p>We should slant all our laws in such a way that they always bring out the necessity of love. When they are of service and useful to our neighbor, we must keep them; when they are harmful, we are to let them go.</p><p>Take a rather crude example! Supposing a housefather had the rule that in his house fish, meat, wine, and beer must be eaten and drunk as it is available and procurable. And supposing that one of his servants became sick and could no longer drink beer or wine, or eat meat or fish, but that the housefather was not prepared to allow him any change of diet, saying, “You know what the rule is! It’s that or nothing else!” What would you think of such a housefather? He should be put on a permanent diet of hellebore to purge his brains!</p><p>If he had any sense at all, he would simply say, “It is quite true that today, according to my rule or ordinance, we should be eating meat or fish. But because this food does not agree with you, eat what you like!”</p><p>David illustrates this point when he ate the bread of the Presence which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests (Matthew 12:3). Neither David nor his servants were consecrated. Did he and his servants sin then in eating the consecrated bread which only the priests were permitted to eat (1 Samuel 21:1‒6)? God’s command was quite clear. David did not sin here. Why? Because the higher law, the law of love, compelled him to act in this way.</p><p>In a Christian context, all laws must be slanted or bent according to the love of one’s neighbor. Where necessity demands it, love knows no laws.</p><p>SL 11:1678 (10,13)<br />AE 79:154‒161</p><p>PRAYER: O God, our heavenly Father, pour out Your love into our hearts in such a manner that it always flows over into our lives in fervent love for one another, in and through Your beloved Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

It’s that or nothing else!” What would you think of such a housefather? He should be put on a permanent diet of hellebore to purge his brains!</p><p>If he had any sense at all, he would simply say, “It is quite true that today, according to my rule or ordinance, we should be eating meat or fish. But because this food does not agree with you, eat what you like!”</p><p>David illustrates this point when he ate the bread of the Presence which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests (Matthew 12:3). Neither David nor his servants were consecrated. Did he and his servants sin then in eating the consecrated bread which only the priests were permitted to eat (1 Samuel 21:1‒6)? God’s command was quite clear. David did not sin here. Why? Because the higher law, the law of love, compelled him to act in this way.</p><p>In a Christian context, all laws must be slanted or bent according to the love of one’s neighbor. Where necessity demands it, love knows no laws.</p><p>SL 11:1678 (10,13)<br />AE 79:154‒161</p><p>PRAYER: O God, our heavenly Father, pour out Your love into our hearts in such a manner that it always flows over into our lives in fervent love for one another, in and through Your beloved Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XVII - TUESDAY</p><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+15%3A1-9&version=ESV">MATTHEW 15:1‒9</a></p><p>Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?” Luke 14:3</p><p>The lawyers and Pharisees, of course, did not believe that it was lawful to heal or to do anything else on the Sabbath day. In this Gospel (Luke 14:1‒11), Jesus shows them that all laws, divine or human, bind us only as far as love permits. For Christians, love must always make the final decision in the interpretation of all laws. Where there is no love, all is over. The Law can only be harmful, no matter what the situation may be.</p><p>It is even a principle of canon law that if any law runs counter to love, it should be set aside as soon as possible. This, in a word, is stated both of divine and human commandments. The reason for this is that all laws have been enacted for the sole purpose of setting up the principle of love, as Paul also reminds us in Romans when he says, “Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.” Likewise: “Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law” (Romans 13:8, 10).</p><p>We owe no one anything but to love one another. If I love my neighbor, I help him, protect him, accord him his due honors, and do to him what I would have others do to me.</p><p>Therefore, since all laws should help to establish the principle of love, they must cease immediately that they run counter to love.

To come to faith, we must know that God is so friendly and merciful to us that He sent us His Son from heaven to help us. This our conscience must hear and believe. Even if all creatures were friendly to us, it would not help us at all in the event of God being ungracious and unfriendly to us. On the other hand, if God is satisfied with us, no creature can harm us, as Paul reminds us when he says in the Epistle to the Romans, “If God is for us, who is against us?” (Romans 8:31). Therefore let death, the devil, hell, and all creatures rave and rage; they can harm us none.</p><p>It is the function of the Gospel graciously to portray the man to us who is none other than God Himself. From this source, our heart draws faith and a friendly confidence towards God, namely, that He will help us through life and death. We also see this in the case of the man whom Jesus cured of dropsy. He had heard of the friendliness of Jesus, and he had come to believe that Jesus would also demonstrate His friendliness and goodness as far as he was concerned. The Pharisees had Jesus before them, but they never really believed in Him; they rejected Him in unbelief. The Gospel goes out to all men in general, but not all accept it. It is often rejected.</p><p>SL 11:1676 (3‒4)<br />AE 79:154‒161</p><p>PRAYER: Remove from our hearts all distrust and unbelief, heavenly Father, and fill our hearts with firm confidence in Your grace, mercy, and love as promised to us and bestowed upon us in and through our Savior.

Every branch of Mine that bears no fruit, He takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit He prunes that it may bear more fruit. You are already made clean by the word which I have spoken to you. Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XVI - SATURDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROMANS+8%3A28-30&version=ESV">ROMANS 8:28-30</a></p><p>For a brief moment I forsook you, but with great compassion I will gather you. In overflowing wrath, for a moment I hid my face from you, but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you, says the Lord, your Redeemer. Isaiah 54:7-8</p><p>The poor widow in this week’s Gospel (Luke 7:11-17) is so closely beset by very great sorrow and fear that she thinks that God, heaven, earth, and everything is opposed to her. Because she looks at all this from the viewpoint of the flesh and as it appears outwardly before her eyes, she must come to the conclusion that it is impossible for her to be released from such anxiety and fear.</p><p>But when her son was awakened from death, it seemed just as if heaven and earth, wood and stone were laughing with her and that everything was rejoicing with her. She forgot all her pain and sorrow. It disappeared just like a little spark of fire is extinguished when it falls into the middle of the sea. Isaiah speaks of a “brief moment.” Sometimes I do not see it that way, and the “brief moment” seems an eternity. But in reality, it is only “a brief moment,” and it is followed by much joy as the psalmist also reminds us, saying, “Thou hast made him little less than God, and dost crown him with glory and honor” (Psalm 8:5). But that can still be hidden for us, and like the widow here in the Gospel, we do not see it. This deceased son is in the midst of life, for God has him in His bosom, and it was God’s intention to awaken him from death. There is a little spark of death there which proved itself his undoing for “a brief moment.” Of course, none of the people present saw it that way. But when he was restored to life again, that which was previously hidden before all the world became manifest.<br />SL 11:1653 (14)</p><p>PRAYER: Your ultimate purposes, O God, are sometimes hidden from us, but we are assured that You are always concerned for our good. So direct and govern us by Your Holy Spirit that, whatever befalls us, we are nevertheless convinced that all things must work for our good, in and through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication. For an alternate English translation of this sermon, see Lenker, Church Postil—Gospels, 5:127-139.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XVI - FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+TIMOTHY+1%3A8-10&version=ESV">2 TIMOTHY 1:8-10</a></p><p>When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?” The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians 15:54-57</p><p>In our eyes, all miracles and works of God are impossible, and it is also impossible for nature to grasp them. The reason for this is that God wants us to recognize Him as an almighty Creator who brings forth a possibility from an impossibility and makes something out of nothing.</p><p>It is impossible for me to become alive again after I have died. Even if I prayed to all the angels and saints for help in this respect, nothing would come of it. What could I hope for from my own free will here? Yet even in death I am bound to say, “I will live.” This does not take place because of anything in myself or due to myself. I know that I have a God who does not make something out of a piece of wood that might be lying before my eyes, but a God who can make a possibility out of an impossibility and something out of nothing. Otherwise, He would not be in reality the true God.</p><p>Hence, if death came to me and I could live no longer, I would still be able to say, “I am still going to live and I want to live. The death which is hovering over me is like a tiny spark of fire, and the life that I hope to live looms as large as the ocean.”</p><p>Reason cannot grasp how this comes to pass. But he who has faith knows this for certain. To the man with faith, death is as a tiny spark of fire in the middle of a great ocean of life, and the little spark is extinguished in a moment. God is almighty; and he who has faith is in God.</p><p>SL 11:1652 (12-13)</p><p>PRAYER: Dear Lord Jesus, You are the conqueror of sin and death. In Your victory we are also conquerors of these bitter enemies. Be with us all the time of our earthly pilgrimage, especially in the hour of our death, for Your truth and name’s sake. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <title>Week of Trinity XVI - Thursday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XVI - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+119%3A121-128&version=ESV">PSALM 119:121-128</a></p><p>“I will not leave you desolate; I will come to you.” John 14:18</p><p>The common lesson taught in all the Gospels is that we should learn from them what kind of God we have. In this week’s Gospel (Luke 7:11-17), the point that is made quite clear is that God forsakes no one. And so, He lets this widow see once again what kind of God she has. When she is forlorn and without a husband or son, Christ demonstrates to her that He is still at her side and says to her in effect, “Learn to believe and trust in God. Recognize Him to whom death and life are both alike. Be brave-hearted and courageous. Do not weep; there is no need for that.”</p><p>Then Jesus steps up, awakens the dead man, and gives him to his mother.</p><p>These and similar miracles are recorded in God’s Word that we may learn in our hearts what attitude to adopt over against God and what we should expect from Him. This woman had certainly made up her mind that she had lost her son and that it was impossible for her to receive him back again. Even if someone had assured her that within an hour her son would be alive again, she would have regarded it as impossible and declared, “It is more likely that the heavens will collapse than that my son should live again.” Before she has time to look about her, God intervenes and does what she had never even dared to regard as a possibility and restores her son to life.</p><p>Why does God follow such a course? He allows a person to fall into such danger and fear that there is no longer any hope at all of counsel or help. But it is not His intention to lead us to despair. He wants us to put our faith and trust in Him alone who can bring forth a possibility from an impossibility, something out of nothing.</p><p>SL 11:1651 (10-11)</p><p>PRAYER: As far as we are concerned, O God, You are never far off but ever ready to help us, ever at our side and along all our paths and ways. Continue to support us with Your boundless grace, in and through Christ our Savior. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

Psalm 31:19</p><p>In what happened to the widow at Nain, God lets us see what kind of God He is, how He regards us, and how we should regard Him.</p><p>This woman was the subject of two misfortunes. In the first place, she was a widow. This is misfortune enough for one woman. She is forlorn and alone, with no one to look to for any comfort. This is why God is often spoken of in Scripture as the God of widows and orphans.</p><p>Secondly, she has an only son who dies. This son should have been a consolation for her. But God intervenes and takes away her husband and her son. She would undoubtedly have preferred to lose her house and home, and even her own life, than this son and her husband.</p><p>God certainly makes some changes here. While her husband was alive, this woman failed to recognize what a gift a husband can be; when he died, she really recognized this for the first time. So also with her son. While he was hale and healthy, she did not recognize him as God’s good gift to her; but after he died, she really recognized for the first time what a treasure she had lost.</p><p>This is how matters stand with us. There are many people who begrudge the investment of ten florins in their child’s education. If the child dies, they suddenly change their mind and say, “Would to God that he was still alive! I would be prepared to spend hundreds of florins, anything, on him.”</p><p>SL 11:1649 (8)</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, heavenly Father, provide us with open minds and hearts so that we always clearly and readily acknowledge the riches of Your goodness toward us and give You due thanks with grateful hearts, through Jesus Christ our Savior.

Romans 5:15</p><p>At times God suffers a man to experience fear and distress, pain and sorrow. He suddenly finds himself in a world which seems to have no God. A man loses his sight; he becomes lame; he develops dropsy. God even lets him die like the widow’s son in this Gospel. All men are God’s creatures, and He can do with them as He pleases.</p><p>Why does God create or suffer such situations? He is resorting here to extreme measures to keep us ever mindful of His goodness. John reports that on one occasion Jesus and His disciples came upon a man who was “blind from his birth. And his disciples asked him, ‘Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?’ Jesus answered, ‘It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be made manifest in him’” (John 9:1-3).</p><p>He means to say, “God wants to be praised in this blind man. God sees that the treasures of the whole world do not move us. Hence, He must take some drastic action. Out of pure grace, He sets a blind man before our eyes so that we come to realize what a precious gift we possess in the gift of sight. And since we do not recognize His goodness and grace in something advantageous, we are compelled to note it and recognize it from something disadvantageous.”</p><p>This man was born blind so that men might come to their senses and declare, “Merciful God, what a precious gift and what a blessing it is to have a healthy body and a fresh countenance!” But no one takes it to heart in this way.</p><p>SL 11:1649 (7)</p><p>PRAYER: Grant us grace at all times, heavenly Father, to interpret Your blessings for what they are, acts of Your grace and mercy, so that we may both acknowledge Your mercy and grace and return You due thanks for it, in and through Christ our Savior.

Romans 9:16</p><p>In this Gospel the evangelist once again sets before us a divine miracle. In it he wants to encourage us to direct our hearts to God if we find ourselves in a situation like the one in which the widow found herself. This account was not written for the sake of this widow but for the sake of those who would hear the Gospel until the end of the world. We must also be counted among the latter.</p><p>In the first place, it should be quite obvious to all of us that the kindness and grace conferred on this woman by Christ was altogether gratuitous; she did not earn it or merit it. She goes through the city with her friends, where there is nothing but wailing and weeping. It never even entered the thought of this good woman that she would bring back her son into the city alive. This is not her desire, and she does not ask for it. Even less did she merit it. Any idea of Christ’s intervention had never occurred to her; she did not know Christ, nor did she know that He helped people. All preceding merit and preparation are ruled out here.</p><p>This has all been recorded so that we may draw a general conclusion from this which applies in the case of all benefits received from God. Just as this widow obtained a blessing freely and out of pure grace alone, solely and only because Christ was moved to pity, so we, too, receive such blessings without any merit on our part and even without seeking them. It is always God who takes the initiative. He always lays the first stone.</p><p>What is the reason for this? He takes pity on us; hence, it remains God’s grace. If our merits counted here, it would not be grace. Accordingly, as a result of this, we can say, “You are a gracious God; you do good to those who do not deserve it.”</p><p>SL 11:1646 (1-3)</p><p>PRAYER: Heavenly Father, Your mercy and grace towards us are never-ending and always abounding.

The same can also be said for fornication; it does at times provide relaxation for the people who practice it. Even anger provides a certain amount of satisfaction. The same could be claimed for other vices as well.</p><p>But covetousness or greed always claims complete and full service from its devotees. It plagues and torments its victims ceaselessly and never provides anything in the shape of pleasure or joy. There the money lies in a heap and claims your full attention and service.

And after protecting this god for so long, the servants of this god have no more than any poor beggar.</p><p>Who brings this about? God, the Lord, arranged matters in this way. They may well be plagued with a sickness which prevents them from eating. They may have something wrong with their digestive processes so that they have no taste for food. They have weak stomachs; their lungs and liver have packed up. They suffer from this or that sickness. Here something is lacking; something else there. They never have a really pleasant hour in which to enjoy eating and drinking.</p><p>This is how those who serve mammon fare.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XV - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+49%3A16-20&version=ESV">PSALM 49:16-20</a></p><p>“The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.” Matthew 13:44</p><p>The world cannot hide its unbelief in its gross public sins. I can plainly see that it has more love for a florin than it has for Christ and all His apostles. Even if the latter were all present and preached in person, it would not change the world’s attitude so much.</p><p>I, too, can hear the Gospel proclaimed daily, but it does not necessarily benefit me daily. But it can also happen, after I have heard the Gospel for a whole year, that the Holy Spirit visits me with a favorable hour. If I obtain such an hour, I do not merely obtain five hundred florins; the riches of the whole world is mine. What would I not have if I had the Gospel?

I can plainly see that it has more love for a florin than it has for Christ and all His apostles. Even if the latter were all present and preached in person, it would not change the world’s attitude so much.</p><p>I, too, can hear the Gospel proclaimed daily, but it does not necessarily benefit me daily. But it can also happen, after I have heard the Gospel for a whole year, that the Holy Spirit visits me with a favorable hour. If I obtain such an hour, I do not merely obtain five hundred florins; the riches of the whole world is mine. What would I not have if I had the Gospel? I would receive God, who is the maker of silver and gold and everything that is on this earth. For I have received a Spirit of such a kind that through Him I know that I will be preserved forever. This is far more than having a church full of florins.</p><p>See whether our heart is not a rogue full of wickedness and unbelief!

No one is very pleased to hear someone telling us that we hate and despise God and are, in fact, His enemies.

You cannot serve God and mammon.” Matthew 6:24</p><p>The man who wants to serve two masters will always find himself in a relationship to one of them which is not service in any sense at all. Matters must always take a course like the one described by the Lord in this week’s Gospel (Matthew 6:24-34). You can force a servant to do something to which he is opposed and which annoys him.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XV - SUNDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW+6%3A24%2C+34&version=ESV">MATTHEW 6:24-34</a></p><p>Be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. James 1:22</p><p>In this Gospel we see how God separates the Christians from the heathen. The Lord does not offer this doctrine to the heathen because they do not accept it; this doctrine is given to Christians. But He does not regard those as His Christians who hear the Word only to learn and recite it by heart, like many of the religious do with the psalter.</p><p>The devil also hears the Word of God and the Gospel in this way; in fact, he knows it better than we do. He could also preach it just as well as we do if he wanted to do so. But the Gospel is a doctrine of such a kind that it always aims at becoming a living force in men’s lives. It must result in action, strengthen men, and comfort them, make them courageous and bold.</p><p>Therefore, those who hear the Gospel only to obtain an external knowledge of it, so that they may be able to discourse learnedly about the wisdom of God, should not be numbered among true Christians. The only real Christians are those who actually put into practice what the Gospel teaches. You will not find so many of these. We see many who are hearers of the Word but not so many who are doers.</p><p>May God grant us His grace that we may always become doers of His Word so that His Gospel does not remain only in our ears and on our tongues, but that it may really reach our hearts and then burst forth in active works of love to our neighbor.</p><p>SL 11:1614 (1-2, 35)</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, heavenly Father, we praise and thank You for the precious gift of Your Word and Gospel in which You reveal all that it is necessary for us to know and believe for our faith and life as Christians. Bestow Your Holy Spirit upon us in rich measure that we never become merely hearers of Your Word, but actual doers of the same, for Christ our Savior’s sake. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XV - SUNDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW+6%3A24%2C+34&version=ESV">MATTHEW 6:24-34</a></p><p>Be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. James 1:22</p><p>In this Gospel we see how God separates the Christians from the heathen. The Lord does not offer this doctrine to the heathen because they do not accept it; this doctrine is given to Christians. But He does not regard those as His Christians who hear the Word only to learn and recite it by heart, like many of the religious do with the psalter.</p><p>The devil also hears the Word of God and the Gospel in this way; in fact, he knows it better than we do. He could also preach it just as well as we do if he wanted to do so. But the Gospel is a doctrine of such a kind that it always aims at becoming a living force in men’s lives. It must result in action, strengthen men, and comfort them, make them courageous and bold.</p><p>Therefore, those who hear the Gospel only to obtain an external knowledge of it, so that they may be able to discourse learnedly about the wisdom of God, should not be numbered among true Christians. The only real Christians are those who actually put into practice what the Gospel teaches. You will not find so many of these. We see many who are hearers of the Word but not so many who are doers.</p><p>May God grant us His grace that we may always become doers of His Word so that His Gospel does not remain only in our ears and on our tongues, but that it may really reach our hearts and then burst forth in active works of love to our neighbor.</p><p>SL 11:1614 (1-2, 35)</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, heavenly Father, we praise and thank You for the precious gift of Your Word and Gospel in which You reveal all that it is necessary for us to know and believe for our faith and life as Christians. Bestow Your Holy Spirit upon us in rich measure that we never become merely hearers of Your Word, but actual doers of the same, for Christ our Savior’s sake. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication. For an alternate English translation of this sermon, see Lenker, Church Postil—Gospels, 5:102-117.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XIV - SATURDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+THESSALONIANS+2%3A11-13&version=ESV">1 THESSALONIANS 2:11‒13</a></p><p>As the body apart from the spirit is dead, so faith apart from works is dead. James 2:26</p><p>We prove the genuineness of our love as Christians by works of love. Jesus said, “By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another” (John 13:35). James declares, “Faith apart from works is dead” (James 2:26). His meaning clearly is: If your life is so arranged that it is not of service to others, that you are living for yourself alone without any consideration for your neighbor, your faith is certainly nothing. In such a case, you are not doing as Christ has done for you. You do not really believe that Christ has done you any good at all, for if you did, you would be compelled by an inner necessity to do good to your neighbor. This is also what Paul means in the celebrated passage in Corinthians: “If I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing” (1 Corinthians 13:2).</p><p>We do not say all this to suggest that faith is not enough to obtain righteousness for you before God, but because in a Christians life these two, faith and love, must always be attached to each other and never separated. There are presumptuous people who think that they can separate them. They want to believe without loving. They despise their neighbor and still want to have Christ. This is a false and wrong view. So we say: faith is everything and saves, so that a man requires nothing more for his salvation.</p><p>But faith is never inactive or lazy. It is always very busy, but it works for the good of the neighbor and not for self. It needs nothing for itself, for it already has all things in Christ. If this is not how faith reacts, there is something wrong with it. Its reaction must be love.</p><p>SL.XI.1583,23<br />AE 79:68-97</p><p>PRAYER: Preserve us, O God, against the error of errors that we are saved by works of righteousness which we ourselves have performed. Keep us ever firm and steadfast in the conviction that we are saved only by God’s grace, through faith in our Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

There is no doubt that He wants to do for everyone what He did for these lepers. All that is necessary is for us to cast ourselves freely upon Him in the expectation of receiving from Him all His grace and goodness.</p><p>In this regard, true faith and a Christian heart should act and does act as these lepers act and teach us to act. That it pleases Christ that we should joyfully and freely determine to build upon His goodness, even before we have experienced it or felt it, is sufficiently attested here in the way in which He so willingly lends an ear to them without any delay at all. Nor does He tell them that He is about to help them. He simply deals with them as if what they desired had already happened. He does not say to them, “Yes, I will have mercy on you; you will be clean.” He simply says, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.”</p><p>It is as though He says to them, “You do not have to make any entreaty. Your faith has already obtained and acquired what you want before you ask for it. You were already clean, as far as I was concerned, when you began to expect all this from Me. Nothing more is needed, then, but that you should go to show the priests that you have been cleansed. As I regard you, and as you believe, so you are and so you will be.” He would not have sent them to the priests had He not regarded them as clean.</p><p>Behold, how powerful faith is! It acquires everything it desires from God, and God regards it as accomplished even before it is asked for. Isaiah speaks of faith when he says, “Before they call I will answer, while they are yet speaking I will hear” (Isaiah 65:24).</p><p>SL.XI.1579,16‒17<br />AE 79:68-97</p><p>PRAYER: Faith is the means whereby You bestow all Your blessings upon us, heavenly Father. When our faith is right, all is right with us as Your children. Preserve us and strengthen us in faith, in and through Christ, the author and finisher of our faith. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XIV - WEDNESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+103%3A1-5&version=ESV">PSALM 103:1‒5</a></p><p>“Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.” Luke 17:13</p><p>Faith never asserts merits or tries to purchase God’s grace with works. It pleads only its utter lack of merits, or its demerits, and clings only to the pure, unmerited goodness and grace of God. This is also demonstrated very well by the lepers who have confident expectations in regard to Christ’s grace, without the performance of any works.</p><p>What good thing could they have done beforehand to impress Him? They had never seen Him before; much less did they have opportunities of serving Him. Then, too, they were lepers whom He would have been compelled to avoid according to the Law (Leviticus 13). It would have been necessary for Him to tell them the rights and wrongs of their situation. Basically, He would have been compelled to tell them the truth that He could have nothing to do with them, and they nothing with Him. That is also why they stand “at a distance,” as those who are well aware of their unworthiness.</p><p>Faith also stands at a distance from God; yet it runs to meet Him and cries out to Him. Faith fully recognizes the truth that it is unworthy of God’s goodness and has nothing on which to rely except His highly celebrated goodness. The soul which stands at a distance and is empty also seeks God’s goodness. This goodness cannot be linked in any way with our merits or works; it will come only of its own accord as Christ comes in this village to the lepers so that their praise might remain free and pure.</p><p>There is complete agreement here. God’s love dispenses His goodness freely and gratuitously. It receives nothing or seeks nothing in payment. Faith receives this goodness as a pure and simple gift, without making any payment of any kind for it.</p><p>SL.XI.1578,12‒14<br />AE 79:68-97</p><p>PRAYER: There is never anything in us, O God, which merits Your grace and goodness, but rather the very opposite of this. Thanks and praise be Yours, heavenly Father, for the riches of Your grace and mercy freely bestowed upon us, in and through our Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XIV - TUESDAY</p><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+9%3A30-33&version=ESV">ROMANS 9:30‒33</a></p><p>As He entered a village, He was met by ten lepers, who stood at a distance and lifted up their voices and said, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.” Luke 17:12‒13</p><p>It is not enough for you to believe that there is a God, and that you make long prayers, as is now the abominable custom. In the case of the lepers, you see how it is a mark of faith to teach men fruitful prayer without any professional instruction. Here you see how they had formed a good opinion about Christ and had acquired a degree of confidence in Him. They also entertained the firm expectation that He would regard them graciously. </p><p>This same expectation made them bold and thirsty, so that they placed their need before Him and with all seriousness and in a loud voice requested His help. Had they not previously gained this high opinion and expectation in regard to Him, they would probably have stayed at home and not come out to meet Him, crying out to Him in a loud voice. In that case, too, doubt would probably have gained the upper hand as they asked themselves: “What are we up to? Who knows if He will react kindly to our requests? Perhaps He will not even look at us!”  </p><p>True faith has no doubt at all about the good and gracious will of God. And so the prayer of true faith is strong, just as faith itself is strong and firm. St. Luke underlines three things in the conduct of these lepers: first, they came out to meet Jesus; secondly, they stood; and thirdly, theylifted up their voices. In these three points, Luke praises their strong faith and sets them before us as examples.</p><p>SL.XI.1575,6<br />AE 79:68-97</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, heavenly Father, all that You have revealed to us about Jesus and His Gospel of salvation is the strongest of incentives to faith and confidence. Grant us Your grace to accept in firm faith all that Your Gospel offers us, in and through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XIV - MONDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+17%3A14-21&version=ESV">MATTHEW 17:14‒21</a></p><p>If I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. I Corinthians 13:2</p><p>This Gospel (Luke 17:11‒19) places before us a simple story or event that is quite easy to understand and requires little explanation.

Up to chapter thirteen, Luke’s Gospel points out how Jesus began to preach and to do signs in Capernaum, to which He went from Nazareth and where He lived.</p><p>From the end of chapter nine till the end of his Gospel, Luke tells us how He preached and performed miracles on His journey from Capernaum to Jerusalem. This was the last journey during His life here on earth and took place during the last year of that life. This is also what Luke is referring to here when he says that “on the way to Jerusalem He was passing along between Samaria and Galilee.” </p><p>This was not the usual route from Capernaum to Jerusalem. He passed along “between Samaria and Galilee” lengthening His journey. The nearest route lay along the borders of these territories. The evangelist is at some pains to remind us here that Jesus did not travel by the usual route to Jerusalem but that He took a time-consuming, more distant and circuitous route on this journey to Jerusalem. </p><p>He did not do this for any personal reasons, but to seize extra opportunities to proclaim the Gospel and to extend His help to people who needed it. He makes His way through the midst of this territory so that His progress might be quite public, and that He might be at everyone’s service. In this way, the people could approach Him from all sides and receive His help.

In this parable, however, Christ more particularly presents the man who does an act of kindness to another as a neighbor.

      <title>Week of Trinity XIII - Friday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XIII - FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON:<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=COLOSSIANS+1%3A9-12&version=ESV"> COLOSSIANS 1:9‒12</a></p><p>“Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.” Matthew 6:10</p><p>We have seen in our consideration of this Gospel (Luke 10:23‒37) what God means when He says, “You shall love the Lord your God.” He means you, the whole you, not only your hands, your mouth, or your knees. When we love God with such a fullness of our being, we fulfill this law.   </p><p>But there is not a single person on this earth who fulfills it in this manner. Indeed, we all do the very opposite. This law makes sinners of all of us, so that not even the smallest letter of this commandment is fulfilled, not even by the greatest saint in the world. No one adheres to God with his whole heart in such a way that he could forsake everything for God’s sake. We have, praise God, advanced so far that we cannot endure giving up even one little word, yes, not even a farthing, for God’s sake! </p><p>How is it possible to love God if His will is not pleasing to us? If I love God, I also love His will. When Gods sends us sickness, poverty, disgrace, and shame, that is His will. But what do we do? We rampage, snort and groan, and accept matters with much impatience. This is the least of our problems. What would we do if we had to give up body and life for God and Christ’s sake? Then I suppose we would show quite another front! In the meantime I act like this Pharisee and lawyer.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XIII - FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON:<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=COLOSSIANS+1%3A9-12&version=ESV"> COLOSSIANS 1:9‒12</a></p><p>“Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.” Matthew 6:10</p><p>We have seen in our consideration of this Gospel (Luke 10:23‒37) what God means when He says, “You shall love the Lord your God.” He means you, the whole you, not only your hands, your mouth, or your knees. When we love God with such a fullness of our being, we fulfill this law.   </p><p>But there is not a single person on this earth who fulfills it in this manner. Indeed, we all do the very opposite. This law makes sinners of all of us, so that not even the smallest letter of this commandment is fulfilled, not even by the greatest saint in the world. No one adheres to God with his whole heart in such a way that he could forsake everything for God’s sake. We have, praise God, advanced so far that we cannot endure giving up even one little word, yes, not even a farthing, for God’s sake! </p><p>How is it possible to love God if His will is not pleasing to us? If I love God, I also love His will. When Gods sends us sickness, poverty, disgrace, and shame, that is His will. But what do we do? We rampage, snort and groan, and accept matters with much impatience. This is the least of our problems. What would we do if we had to give up body and life for God and Christ’s sake? Then I suppose we would show quite another front! In the meantime I act like this Pharisee and lawyer. I lead a fine life outwardly, honor God and serve Him, fast, pray, and always put on a very pious and holy front. But God does not look for this. He wants His will to be accepted joyfully and in love. In this respect we continue to drag our feet. </p><p>SL 11:1542 (18)</p><p>PRAYER: O God, make us ready and willing at all times to obey Your holy will, not grudgingly and impatiently, but wholeheartedly, feely and openly, for Christ our Savior’s sake. Amen. </p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XIII - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROMANS+1%3A18-25&version=ESV">ROMANS 1:18‒25</a></p><p>“You shall worship the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve.” Matthew 4:10</p><p>God allows us to love His creatures; that is why He created them and made them good. The sun is a fine creation of God; gold and silver and everything that is fair and beautiful quite naturally engender love in us. God readily permits us to love these creatures. But to cling to them and equate our love for them with our love for Him, this He neither will nor can tolerate. Indeed, it is His will that I should deny and forsake all if He wants me to do so, and that I should be satisfied even if I never saw the sun, money, or any of my property again.</p><p>Love of creatures must always stand a very long distance beneath love of Himself. Even as He is the supreme good, so He wants us to love Him in the highest manner before everything else. If He does not want me to love anything beside Himself, much less does He want anything to be loved above Himself, although both of these alternatives amount to the same thing.</p><p>Now, I believe, you can see what it means to love God with your whole heart, and your whole soul, and your whole mind. To love God with your whole heart is to love Him above all creatures. Although many creatures are quite lovable and please me well and I love them, I should still be fully prepared to disregard them and let them go for God’s sake, if God, my Lord, so wills it.</p><p>SL 11:1541 (13‒14)</p><p>PRAYER: We thank and praise You, heavenly Father, for all the good gifts of Your creation. Grant us the moderation and understanding to use these creatures according to Your will and for our neighbor’s benefit, in Christ’s name and for His sake.

He probably even thinks that the Lord will commend and praise his life right here before all the people.

Christ can really be quite unfriendly and anything but kind, especially when He tells people the plain, unvarnished truth. One can understand why some people became so cross with Him. This pious, holy lawyer is still standing on his head. He has but one aim in view: to cash in on the very high reputation he has won by his holy living. He is quite sure that he has fulfilled all the commandments. He hopes to hear from Christ the commendation, “My good man, you have done everything; all is well with you.” But Christ says: “Do this!” In plain language Christ means to tell him, “You are a complete fake; you have never at any time kept this law, not even a letter of it.” He shows this man his wickedness.

Empty our hearts of all false pride and self-righteousness, that Your grace and mercy may enter and abide there, in and through our Savior Jesus Christ.

How do you read?” And he answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.” And He said to him, “You have answered right; do this, and you will live.” Luke 10:25‒28</p><p>I think that the Lord set out to teach this pious man a very elementary lesson. And yet, such treatment of such a fine man can hardly be right. Surely, He should have shown more consideration for this man! He puts him to shame before the whole world. How can this help the man? He shows this man, who had imagined that he had done everything, that he has really done nothing. He asks: “What shall I do?” When Jesus was finished with him, he certainly had enough and more than enough to do.</p><p>A great deal of very necessary comment could easily be supplied on the two commandments which this man quotes for Jesus. They are the most significant and most important parts of Moses. As Jesus says, “On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets” (Matthew 22:40).</p><p>If we examine all the laws in Moses, we shall see that they all have reference to love. I cannot explain or interpret the commandment, “You shall have no other gods before Me” (Exodus 20:3), as having any other meaning than “You shall love God alone.” This is how Moses himself explains it in Deuteronomy when he says, “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might” (Deuteronomy 6:4‒5).</p><p>SL 11:1538 (6‒8)</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, heavenly Father, guide us at all times by Your Holy Spirit to a full and correct understanding of Your holy Word, so that it achieves in us the purposes for which You have given it to us and receives its full meaning for us, in and through Jesus Christ. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XIII - SUNDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=LUKE+10%3A23-37&version=ESV">LUKE 10:23‒37</a></p><p>Turning to the disciples, He said privately, “Blessed are the eyes which see what you see! For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.” Luke 10:23‒24</p><p>This seeing and hearing must be understood quite simply as external seeing and hearing, namely, that they saw Christ in His own person and in the office He fulfilled, heard His preaching, and witnessed the miracles which He performed among the Jews. They were all in a position to confess with Peter, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God” (Matthew 16:16).</p><p>Many prophets and kings also saw Christ, but only in spirit. The Lord Himself said to the Jews, “Your father Abraham rejoiced that he was to see My day; he saw it and was glad” (John 8:56). On that occasion the Jews thought that Jesus was speaking about a physical seeing; but Jesus was referring to the spiritual seeing whereby all pious Christian hearts saw Jesus before He was born and still see Him today. If Abraham saw Him in this way, there is no doubt that many prophets, in whom the Holy Spirit resided, also saw Him thus. This spiritual seeing brought salvation to the holy fathers and prophets, but they also experienced a heartfelt desire and longing to see the Lord Jesus Christ in the flesh. This is indicated here and there in the prophets.</p><p>The Lord here says to His disciples, who both heard and saw Him in the flesh, “Blessed are the eyes which see what you see!” He means to say, “This is a blessed time, an acceptable year, a time of grace. What is now present before you is so precious that the eyes which see it are quite rightly called blessed. Never before has the Gospel been proclaimed to every man with such publicity and clarity.”</p><p>SL 11:1536 (2‒4)</p><p>PRAYER: Jesus, Lord and Savior, You pronounced Your disciples blessed for being able to see and hear Your works of grace and Your Gospel of salvation. Help us to a similar experience of blessedness in connection with Your Gospel of salvation, for Your name’s sake.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XII - SATURDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+JOHN+5%3A9-15&version=ESV">1 JOHN 5:9‒15</a></p><p>“Whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.” Matthew 21:22</p><p>As Christians who are priests before God, we should say, “Christ was certainly a priest in the fact that He prayed for me and acquired personal faith and the gift of the Spirit for me. Hence, I also am a priest who should continue to pray to God that He should give faith to this man or that man.” We should have the firm persuasion that we shall receive what we pray for boldly in faith, in accordance with Christ’s promise, “Ask, and you will receive” (John 16:24).</p><p>To pray boldly is not always in our power. The Spirit does not always give the ability to pray boldly. Paul prayed to God for Israel that they might be saved (Romans 10:1). Why was his prayer not successful? It was a matter of faith. The Holy Spirit withheld it. Had Paul been able to pray for this with boldness, it would most certainly have happened. Had Paul said, “I pray for the whole of Israel,” and had he believed boldly and said, “Lord, I am certain that You will do it,” it would certainly have happened. It was certainly his heart’s desire and one which he often expressed, but the Holy Spirit never enabled him to believe it with confidence.</p><p>It is not within our power to pray with bold confidence; the Holy Spirit must give us this confidence. When we pray for anyone with the confident addition, “It will certainly happen,” it will certainly happen. But normally we Christians must pray with the addition, “Your will be done!” If I must leave it to His will, then I cannot prescribe person, time, or manner to Him, but leave it to His good pleasure. This gives me adequate certainty. This is also what Christ did. He prayed in the garden, “My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt” (Matthew 26:39).</p><p>SL 11:1522 (15‒16)</p><p>PRAYER: Heavenly Father, give us a full measure of Your Holy Spirit, enabling us to pray at all times in faith and confidence, through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

But with my faith, I will pray to God for you to give you a personal faith of your own. John says that Christ has “made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father” (Revelation 1:6). Like Christ Himself, we may now step forth on behalf of others and pray that God may bestow a personal faith on them. Hence, if I see that you do not have such a faith, or a weak faith, I go off and pray to God to help you to such a faith. I do not give you my own faith and works, but I pray God to give you your own faith and works. I pray to God that Christ may give you all His works and salvation through faith, as He has given us His blessings through faith.</p><p>This is also the point in the passage quoted above from John’s Gospel. Christ means to say here, “I have prayed and had dealings with God on your behalf so that He may give you what is Mine. Therefore, acknowledge My name. Through My prayer for you, He has accepted you and given you faith, so that from now on you may pray for yourselves. I do not have to do it for you, but you should do it for yourselves in My name.”</p><p>Here God crowned us, consecrated us, and anointed us with the Holy Spirit so that we are all priests and each one should pray for the other. We are a royal priesthood of believers.</p><p>SL 11:1521 (13‒14)</p><p>PRAYER: Among our greatest distinctions, Lord Jesus, is this, that You have given us individually the status of being kings and priests before God, our heavenly Father. Grant us at all times a clear understanding of our privileges as priests, especially in intercessions for the needs of our brethren. We pray in Your name, Lord Jesus.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XII - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=LUKE+12%3A35-40&version=ESV">LUKE 12:35‒40</a></p><p>“Then all those maidens rose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil for our lamps are going out.’ But the wise replied, ‘perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.’” Matthew 25:7-9</p><p>It is important for you to know how far another man’s faith can help you. The merits of others can prompt you to acquire merits of your own, but that is their limit. Even if all the angels and God’s mercy itself took your part, it would not help you, unless you adhered to that mercy with a faith of your own. One thing another man’s faith can do for you is to help you acquire a personal faith for yourself.</p><p>Similarly, even if Christ, after dying for us and giving His body and life, blood and flesh for us, were to intercede for us, it would still not help us, unless we believed in Him. But He can help us by interceding for us with His heavenly Father and saying, “Dear Father, all this I have done for men; give them faith that they may avail themselves of it.” This also helps us after we regard His works and merits as our very own possession. The same thing applies in respect to all the other saints. Their intercession and merits are of no avail at all to us unless we have personal faith.</p><p>You see this also from the events set forth in this Gospel (Mark 7:31‒37). The poor man lies there helpless; he cannot speak or hear anything. Those who brought him to the Lord can speak and hear. He does not acquire the ability to speak through their hearing and speaking. Even if they had all come forward and said, “We want to speak and hear for you,” he would have remained speechless and deaf forever and never have acquired the ability to speak.</p><p>If you make use of your faith to help me to personal faith for myself, that is helping me. Otherwise, no work or ties of brotherhood are of any avail.</p><p>SL 11:1520 (11‒12)</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, heavenly Father, make our faith a living power in our lives, not only to believe all that You have promised us, but also to do all You command us, for Jesus’ sake. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

One thing another man’s faith can do for you is to help you acquire a personal faith for yourself.</p><p>Similarly, even if Christ, after dying for us and giving His body and life, blood and flesh for us, were to intercede for us, it would still not help us, unless we believed in Him. But He can help us by interceding for us with His heavenly Father and saying, “Dear Father, all this I have done for men; give them faith that they may avail themselves of it.” This also helps us after we regard His works and merits as our very own possession. The same thing applies in respect to all the other saints. Their intercession and merits are of no avail at all to us unless we have personal faith.</p><p>You see this also from the events set forth in this Gospel (Mark 7:31‒37). The poor man lies there helpless; he cannot speak or hear anything. Those who brought him to the Lord can speak and hear. He does not acquire the ability to speak through their hearing and speaking. Even if they had all come forward and said, “We want to speak and hear for you,” he would have remained speechless and deaf forever and never have acquired the ability to speak.</p><p>If you make use of your faith to help me to personal faith for myself, that is helping me. Otherwise, no work or ties of brotherhood are of any avail.</p><p>SL 11:1520 (11‒12)</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, heavenly Father, make our faith a living power in our lives, not only to believe all that You have promised us, but also to do all You command us, for Jesus’ sake. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XII - WEDNESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW+9%3A18-22&version=ESV">MATTHEW 9:18‒22</a></p><p>He said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.” Luke 7:50</p><p>This Gospel (Mark 7:31‒37) suggests discussion on the part played by another’s faith in our salvation. These men brought the deaf man to Jesus as a fruit of their faith in Jesus. The deaf man made no contribution at all; he played an entirely passive role.</p><p>We should note at the outset that it is quite impossible to be saved by another man’s faith in the sense that the other man does the believing for you and in your place. But it may well happen that through another man’s faith, you yourself come to personal faith. In a similar way, the works of another man can help me or influence me to perform works of my own. Those people are lying who claim that we can be saved through the works and faith of others, whether we have personal faith for ourselves or not. It is not so! Unless you derive a personal faith for yourself from God’s goodness and mercy, you cannot be saved.</p><p>This is how the case stands. If you do not have your own personal faith, neither the faith nor work of another man will help you, not even Christ who is a Savior for the whole world. His goodness and His help avails you nothing unless you yourself have faith in Him, and are thereby enlightened. Therefore, be on your guard against anyone who directs you for help to another’s faith. Tell such a would-be helper, “If you want to serve me with your works, make an approach to God and say to Him, ‘Dear heavenly Father, through Your grace I have come to faith, therefore I beseech You, my God, give this poor man faith also.’ This could help me, but it is impossible for you to give me your own faith. And even if you could do so, it would help me not at all.”</p><p>SL 11:1518 (7‒9)</p><p>PRAYER: Heavenly Father, of all the many gifts which You have bestowed upon us in Your grace and mercy, none is more important to us than the gift of faith. Make our faith strong and a powerful source of good works, through Your holy Gospel and for Christ’s sake. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XII - MONDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+57%3A1-3&version=ESV">PSALM 57:1‒3</a></p><p>Bear one another’s burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ. Galatians 6:2</p><p>The Gospel for this week (Mark 7:31‒37) describes works of love. These men seize the initiative and go to the poor, deaf man with speech troubles to lend him a hand. Without their merits or any initiative from them, Christ sends forth His Word and attends to the spreading of His goodness and mercy. Accordingly, after drawing from the fountain, there is an outflowing from them which is quite spontaneous. They now share gratuitously with their neighbor, without any condemnation of merits.</p><p>Love must always do its work in this way, quite freely and with no other consideration but the neighbor’s welfare. Among other things, St. Paul says of love that it “does not insist on its own way” (1 Corinthians 13:5). To the Philippians he writes, “Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others” (Philippians 2:4).</p><p>This is the attitude which we find here also among these pious people. They do not need the work in question. They do not consider simply their own interests; they think only of the poor, deaf man and of how they can help him. They seek no reward. They render their services to this man quite gratuitously.</p><p>This is also the kind of sincerity which should mark your good deeds to your neighbor or otherwise you are not Christians. Mark well, then, how love is described here. It takes upon itself another man’s troubles. If we follow this example, good for us. If we refuse to follow it, God can punish us with the blindness which afflicted our forebears for almost four hundred years.</p><p>SL 11:1517 (5‒6)</p><p>PRAYER: It is your will, heavenly Father, that we should always practice our faith, especially in the love which we show to each other. Grant us your grace that we love each other without any self-interest, looking not to our own things but to the things of our neighbor, in and through Christ our Savior.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XI - SATURDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=LUKE+7%3A36-50&version=ESV">LUKE 7:36‒50</a></p><p>Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word. 2 Thessalonians 2:16</p><p>The tax collector (Luke 18:9‒14) stands there and humbles himself. He mentions no fasting, no good work; he mentions nothing at all. And yet the Lord says that this man’s sins are not as great as the hypocrite’s. A man must really be bold if, in the face of all this, he would feel inclined to exalt himself above the least of sinners. If I draw myself up even a finger’s breadth above my neighbor, or above the worst of sinners, I am thrown down. The tax collector during his whole life did not commit so many and so great sins as this Pharisee here committed when he said, “God, I thank Thee that I am not like other men,” and lied so that heaven might well have thundered in reply. You hear no word here like the tax collector’s plea: “God, be merciful to me, a sinner!” God’s mercy, tenderheartedness, and love are clean forgotten.</p><p>God is nothing but sheer and pure mercy, and he who does not see this does not believe in God at all, as the psalmist also declares, “The fool says in his heart, ‘There is no God’” (Psalm 14:1). This is where the unbeliever finishes up with his lack of self-knowledge.</p><p>I will add just one more remark here. Even if this man had committed the very worst of sins like deflowering virgins, it would not have been as bad as saying, “God, I thank Thee that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers.” To be sure, Pharisee, do I hear you? Do you have no need of God? Do you despise His goodness, mercy, love, and all that He is? These are real sins. It is not a question here of open sins breaking out. It is a matter of unbelief in the heart, which we cannot see. This is always the real sin.</p><p>SL 11:1493 (20)</p><p>PRAYER: Heavenly Father, the consequences of unbelief, cutting ourselves off from all grace and mercy, are truly fearsome and must lead to despair. Keep us firm in faith and duly humble by keeping us close to our Savior, in whose name we also ask this. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

He is adorned with the most beautiful works. First, he gives thanks to God, fasts twice in the week, and gives a tithe on his whole income to God, not to St. Nicholas or St. Barbara. He has not broken up his marriage or committed an act of violence against anyone. He is not the kind of man to insist on his rights; he has always preserved an unblemished record of piety.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XI - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+9%3A7-12&version=ESV">PSALM 9:7‒12</a></p><p>“The tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast.” Luke 18:13</p><p>We are urged to produce works as evidence of faith, not that we should pile up merits by them. Doing works freely and gratuitously for the benefit of our neighbor must become our normal procedure. In urging such works upon us, God is saying to us in effect, “If you have faith, heaven is yours. But even so, in order not to deceive yourselves, do some works.”</p><p>The Lord pointed this out in an excellent manner when He said to His disciples, “This I command you, to love one another” (John 15:17). And just before this, during evening supper, He said, “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another” (John 13:34‒35).</p><p>Before this He stated, “I have given you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you” (John 13:15). Christ means to say here, “You are My friends, but no one can detect this from your faith. But if you show forth fruits of faith, and your love bursts forth, people will be able to recognize you as My friends. The fruits will not save you or make you My friends; you must prove yourselves to be My friends, and that you are saved by your fruits of faith.”</p><p>Therefore, note this well! Faith alone makes you godly. Although it is a living force and a great treasure, because it lies hidden in you, works must emerge and attest your faith to the praise of God’s grace and the condemnation of the works of men. You must lower your eyes and humble yourself before everyone so as to win over your neighbor by your service to him. For this reason also, God prolongs your life; otherwise, you would have deserved to lose your head long since. This you see well illustrated in this pious tax collector.</p><p>SL 11:1490 (13)</p><p>PRAYER: Strengthen our faith, heavenly Father, by Your means of grace, that we may always produce abundant proof of our faith in good works to our neighbor, for Christ’s sake. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XI - TUESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+CORINTHIANS+4%3A13-15&version=ESV">2 CORINTHIANS 4:13‒15</a></p><p>“I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other.” Luke 18:14</p><p>The tax collector’s faith certainly proves itself by its fruits. How do we explain Christ’s statement here that he “went down to his house justified rather than the other”? We have suggested that this tax collector was justified before the happenings recorded in this Gospel and before he beat upon his breast as here reported. What does Christ mean here, then, with the statement that “he went down to his house justified”?</p><p>This refers to something I have frequently stressed previously: if faith is as it should be, it will break out and produce fruit. If the tree is green and good, there is no coming to a standstill; it must sprout and produce fruit and leaves. Nature sees to this. I do not have to command the tree and say, “Listen to me, tree, produce apples!” If the tree is there and it is a good tree, fruit comes of its own accord. If true faith exists anywhere, works must follow.</p><p>If I confess myself to be a sinner, it follows that I must also say, “Dear God, I am a rogue; make me godly!” So also the tax collector here. He does not hold back, but speaks out quite freely. He is not afraid of disgracing himself before other people. He must come out with his faith, saying, “God, be merciful to me a sinner!” It is as though he meant to say, “Now I see that all is shattered for me; I am a rogue and acknowledge my sin. There is nothing else for me now but to believe in God and cling to His mercy, to implore His grace; otherwise I am ruined.”</p><p>In this way faith casts itself upon God. It breaks forth and establishes itself through works. When that happens in a man, I can recognize him as a believer and so can others.</p><p>SL 11:1488 (8‒9)</p><p>PRAYER: When You bring men to true faith, heavenly Father, You also empower them to prove their faith in their lives. Make our faith such a power in our lives that all men will know that we are Your children and glorify Your holy name, in and through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication. For an alternate English translation of this sermon, see Lenker, Church Postil—Gospels, 4:336-347.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XI - MONDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+PETER+5%3A6-11&version=ESV">1 PETER 5:6‒11</a></p><p>“The tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’” Luke 18:13</p><p>It seems that the tax collector must have heard something of God’s Word beforehand, that he believed this Word and became a godly man as a result of this, as Paul says, “Faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes by the preaching of Christ” (Romans 10:17). When God’s Word takes hold of a man’s heart, it purifies him and makes him truly pious and godly. The evangelist does not expressly say here that the tax collector had heard the Gospel, but he gives certain indications that he had heard it somewhere or other, for he makes the tax collector exclaim, “God, be merciful to me, a sinner!”</p><p>Such an exclamation is beyond all the powers of human reason. Therefore he must have become acquainted previously with the fact that God is gracious, merciful, and friendly to all who recognize their sins, who call upon Him and desire His grace. He had heard that God in His heart of hearts is gracious to all who humble themselves and who look to Him for comfort and consolation.</p><p>The beginning of all true piety must never be sought in ourselves but in the Word of God. God must first let His Word sound forth in our hearts. Through this Word we learn to know God and come to faith in Him. After this, we are equipped for good works. Accordingly, we must also infer here that the tax collector in some way or other heard the Word of God. If this were not so, it would certainly have been quite impossible for him to confess himself to be a sinner as the Gospel reports it. He would not have been humbled and beaten his breast unless there were true faith in his heart beforehand.</p><p>SL 11:1487 (5‒6)</p><p>PRAYER: Thanks and praise be to You, heavenly Father, for the precious gift of Your Word. Grant that we may always accept Your Word with our whole heart so that it always proves itself a powerful influence in our lives, fully sanctifying us, for Christ the Savior’s sake.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XI - SUNDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=LUKE+18%3A9-14&version=ESV">LUKE 18:9‒14</a></p><p>“Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.” Luke 18:10</p><p>You have already heard that before any man can do what is good and pleasing in God’s sight he must already be a pious man, that is, he must be accounted as justified and righteous before God by faith in Christ. At all times it remains universally true that a good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and, contrariwise, that a bad tree cannot produce good fruit. If a man is to do what is good, he must be good beforehand. So also here. The tax collector beats his breast, and this act may be regarded as a mark of the faith he already had in his heart.</p><p>This took place and was recorded so that we should really open our eyes and not judge people merely by outward appearances. We must try to discover what was in the heart of these two men and not simply form a judgement according to works. If the heart is godly, all is godly. If this tax collector is judged by works, you soon come to a false conclusion. It appears that in him there is nothing but sin. Likewise, when I judge the hypocritical Pharisee here according to works, I also finish up with a wrong conclusion. He stands in the holy place, makes a fine prayer, praises and thanks God with impressive works, fasts, gives tithes, and harms no one. Everything about this man glitters. His standards find universal approval.</p><p>It is not easy to reject the testimony of such an honorable, virtuous life. Who would venture to assert that fasting is not good, that praising God and rendering to every man his due is something evil? When I look at a priest, monk, or nun, I regard them as godly. Who can gainsay me? But if I am to determine that this man is evil and that man godly, I must look into their hearts. This I cannot do.</p><p>SL 11:1486 (2‒4)</p><p>PRAYER: We know that it is quite useless, heavenly Father, to play the role of a hypocrite, because You can always look into our hearts and judge us accordingly. Purify our hearts from all base motives, that the services we render You may truly please You and benefit our neighbor, for Christ’s sake. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY X - FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+THESSALONIANS+2%3A12-17&version=ESV">2 THESSALONIANS 2:12‒17</a></p><p>And He entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold, saying to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be a house of prayer’; but you have made it a den of robbers.” Luke 19:45‒46</p><p>The temple and the whole priesthood was established to promote God’s Word and for the praise of His grace and mercy. This was to be attested with the external service of sacrifices and in public thanksgivings. But the temple services were not simply regarded by the Jews as opportunities for praising and thanking God for His grace and mercy; they turned their temple worship into a monkish doctrine of works. With their sacrifices in the temple, they believed that they could earn God’s grace for themselves, and that by the making of many sacrifices they could influence God to give them heaven and all earthly blessings as well.</p><p>All that they should have expected from God on the basis of God’s pure goodness and grace, they based on their own works and merits. In addition, in the devil’s name they went so far in all this that in their greed they set up tables for money-changers and seats for those who sold pigeons and other animals to offer as sacrifices right in the temple, so that those who came from distant lands and cities might find enough to purchase or exchange their money there. This they did to increase the trade in sacrificial animals and to enrich themselves in the process.</p><p>In the name of worship and under the excuse of worship, they absolutely distorted all worship and destroyed it. They changed God’s grace and mercy into human merit, and His gift into human work which He had to accept from them and for which He had to thank them.</p><p>SL 11:1482 (36)<br />AE 78:346-361</p><p>PRAYER: In Your Word, O Lord, You are giving to us; we are not giving to You. Keep us ever mindful of the fact that You are the source of all blessing, and that we are always receivers solely dependent on Your grace, in and through Christ our Savior. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY X - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+PETER+4%3A12-19&version=ESV">1 PETER 4:12‒19</a></p><p>“Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for My name’s sake, will receive a hundredfold, and inherit eternal life.” Matthew 19:29</p><p>In many ways we resemble the Jews. They were more concerned about their bellies than about God, more intent on filling their bellies than on learning God’s plan of salvation for them. Ultimately, therefore, they lost out in both directions, and deservedly so. Inasmuch as they refused to accept eternal life and joy, God also deprived them of their bodily welfare, and so they lost both body and soul.</p><p>They offer an excuse which rings much like those we also hear today from our contemporaries, “We would have been quite glad to accept the Gospel, had it not endangered our body and property, and perhaps even cost us wife and children.” “If we let Him go on thus,” some of them said in reference to Christ, “everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation” (John 11:48).</p><p>What they here feared would happen did happen, for as Solomon said, “What the wicked dreads, will come upon him” (Proverbs 10:24). These fears prevented the Jews from believing in God. They did not regard the great and rich promises which God had made to them.</p><p>We also pass over such matters and do not see the mighty, comforting promises which our Lord has made us. Even if we do lose our earthly property, heaven and earth are the Lord’s, and He will certainly repay us freely and richly.</p><p>SL 11:1474 (16)<br />AE 78:346-361</p><p>PRAYER: Heavenly Father, Your blessings and benefits to us are many and great, as are all the free gifts of Your love and mercy. Open our hearts in such a way that we never offer any hindrance to the operation of your free and wonderful grace, and so that we may be prepared at all times to suffer everything and risk everything for Christ’s sake.

Let us learn a lesson from this, because it certainly concerns us and all other men.</p><p>This is no joking matter, and we have no reason at all to suppose that our experience will be so different.

And what is even more serious, there are those who persecute and revile the Gospel.</p><p>God is patient and bides His time for a while. If we simply misread open facts and push matters too far, however, He can take His Word away from us, and the same wrath which fell upon the Jews can also fall on us. For we have the same Word, and the same God and Christ that the Jews had. We, too, will suffer the same punishment that the Jews suffered, for the same sin that they committed, despising and rejecting God’s Word and, more particularly, His Gospel of salvation in Christ. “Today, when you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts” (Hebrews 3:7).</p><p>SL 11:1471 (10‒14)<br />AE 78:346-361</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, Your warning voice is always quite plain. We have no one but ourselves to blame if we fail to recognize the day of Your visitation. Keep us always fully aware of the serious nature of Your offer of salvation, in and through Christ our Savior. Amen.</p>

However, He does not wait for us to come to Him; He gets in first and comes to us. He comes into the world; He becomes man; He serves us, dies for us, rises again, and sends us His Holy Spirit. He also gives us His Word and opens up heaven so widely that all stands open. In addition, He gives us rich promises and assurances of His temporal and eternal care here on earth and in heaven and pours out His grace upon us in full measure.</p><p>We are now living in a rich time of grace, but we despise it and throw it to the winds. This He cannot disregard.</p><p>SL 11:1472 (12‒13)<br />AE 78:346-361</p><p>PRAYER: In Your Word and Gospel, O God, You have bestowed rich and precious gifts upon us, and by Your mercy and grace we have enjoyed a rich season of grace. May we never lose the appreciation of the precious nature of Your rich blessings to us, but ever continue in their full enjoyment, in and through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY X - SUNDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=LUKE+19%3A41-48&version=ESV">LUKE 19:41‒48</a></p><p>When He drew near and saw the city, He wept over it. Luke 19:41</p><p>The events described in this Gospel occurred on the day we usually call Palm Sunday when Jesus, amidst public acclaim, entered Jerusalem as the king of grace. On that occasion He proceeded at once to the temple, and there He preached for three days on end. This He had never done before. The sum and content of this Gospel is Christ’s deep concern over those who despise God’s Word and His lament over their ultimate distress.</p><p>You have often heard what the Word of God is, what it brings with it, and what kind of students it encounters. This Gospel tells us nothing of these aspects. It simply sets before us the punishment and distress which will come upon the Jews because they did not know the time of their visitation. We must take a close look at all this because it also concerns us.

Here, however, Jesus speaks only of those who do not know the time of their visitation.</p><p>There are two ways of preaching against those who despise the Word of God. Christ illustrates one method when He pronounces His woes upon Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum, declaring that it will be more tolerable for Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom on the day of judgement than for these places (Matthew 11:20‒24).</p><p>The other method of dealing with those who reject God’s Word is illustrated here in this Gospel when Jesus weeps over Jerusalem. He feels the deepest of compassion for these poor, blind people. He does not reprove or threaten them as hardened and deluded sinners. His heart melts in love for them. He has compassion for those enemies.</p><p>SL 11:1468 (1‒4)<br />AE 78:346-361</p><p>PRAYER: Lord Jesus, as You shed tears of mercy and compassion over Jerusalem, so also let us experience Your love and compassion whenever we stand before You as sinners in need of salvation, for Your mercy and truth’s sake.

Psalm 143:2</p><p>It seems, on the surface, that Christ in this week’s Gospel (Luke 16:1-9) actually suggests that we should do good works by means of unrighteous mammon, so that we may obtain eternal life thereby and that those whom we have helped with our mammon may receive us into eternal habitations.</p><p>Our opponents are not slow to remind us that we have always taught we should not do good works to inherit eternal life and that what we read here seems to be the direct opposite of this doctrine. What are we going to say to this? There are many passages here and there in Scripture which speak of our merits. With these, our opponents think they can set God’s mercy at naught and force us to adopt the position that we must satisfy God’s justice with our good works. Be on your guard against such views and take up your stand on God’s pure grace and mercy alone, saying, “I am a poor sinner, O God; forgive me my sins. I will gladly keep silent about my merits if you will only keep silent about your judgement.”</p><p>Why was Christ given us as our Mediator? If we want God to enter into judgement with us on the basis of good works, we push Christ aside as our Mediator. And without Christ’s work of mediation, we cannot stand before God. Hence, let Him remain your mediator. Seek the cover of His wings as the psalmist advises: “He will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will find refuge” (Psalm 91:4).</p><p>Let this be your prayer: “O God, I do not presume to claim any merit before you from my works, but devote them to the service of my neighbor, placing all my faith and trust in your pure mercy alone.”<br />SL 11:1452 (14)</p><p>PRAYER: We give You eternal thanks and praise, heavenly Father, for the riches of Your grace and mercy continually bestowed upon us poor, lost, and condemned sinners, in and through our Savior and Mediator, Your Son Jesus Christ.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY IX - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+15&version=ESV">PSALM 15</a></p><p>Faith working through love. Galatians 5:6</p><p>Scripture also speaks of our walk of life externally, of how we are to walk with our fellowmen as human beings made up of flesh and blood. That I am accounted truly righteous before God is something that you do not know, and I myself cannot simply take it for granted. I must make my faith sure and certain for myself and other people as well. I must do good to my neighbor so that my faith proves itself.</p><p>External works are signs of inward faith. These works do not actually make me godly and pious, but they demonstrate that I am godly and pious and attest that I have the right faith. This is how I must understand the injunction of the Gospel, “Make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous mammon,” that is, do good to make your faith sure and certain. So, we must distinguish between the Spirit and the fruit of the Spirit.</p><p>Luke describes the fruit of faith as giving to the poor and making friends for ourselves in this way. He means to say to us: “I do not want to speak to you now about faith as such, but about how you should prove your faith. Do good to your neighbor, and if you can really give to him out of the goodness of your heart, you can be quite sure about your faith.”</p><p>Scripture at times speaks about the fruits of faith, at other times about faith as such. It speaks to us about the fruits faith when we are told in Matthew that on judgement day the Lord will say to those who have been rejected on His left hand, “I was hungry, and you gave me no food; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink” (Matthew 25:42). He will point out to those on His left hand that they did not really believe in Him and will demonstrate their unbelief from their lack of fruits of faith.</p><p>SL 11:1451 (11-12)</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, faith that does not prove itself in works of love is a dead faith and of no value at all, as You plainly demonstrate in many clear passages of Your holy Word. Grant us Your grace and strength at all times to prove that our faith is a faith that works by love, in and through our Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[THE WEEK OF TRINITY IX - MONDAY

LESSON: 1 TIMOTHY 6:17-19

“The master commended the dishonest steward for his prudence; for the sons of this world are wiser in their own generation than the sons of light.” Luke 16:8

We shall understand the story by which Jesus makes his point in this week’s Gospel (Luke 16:1-9) in its simple meaning, without introducing a large number of subtleties into it, as Jerome has done. It is not always necessary to search out such a pointed meaning; the milk of the story is enough for us.

We do not necessarily have to explain here in what way this steward had wasted his master’s goods, and how it comes to pass that even after this he still succeeds in using up his master’s property for himself treacherously, fraudulently, and falsely.

Christ concludes that the steward acted prudently or astutely. He does not praise him for being good. He actually finds fault with him for having wasted his master’s goods and also for ensuring the continuance of his comfortable existence by treacherously playing fast and loose with his master’s goods. What the master in the story commends is that this man did not forget his self-interest in a critical situation; he commends the steward’s craftiness. It is like saying of a harlot who has the whole world at her feet, “She is a clever harlot.”

From all this, Christ draws the conclusion: just as this steward displays outstanding craftiness in matters concerning his earthly welfare, we also should be deeply concerned about our eternal welfare and eternal life.

SL 11:1448 (5)

PRAYER: Lord God, heavenly Father, the treasures and riches of heaven and its glories far outweigh the most desirable riches and treasures that our earthly life affords. Grant us a zeal and concern for our spiritual welfare that is at least the equal of the craftiness and shrewdness whereby men sell their souls for earthly happiness. We ask it in Jesus’ name. Amen.

If we accept anything, we should accept it because it agrees with our conscience as instructed by Holy Scripture, not just because pope or council orders it. St. Paul says in Romans that if a man has prophecy, it should be in agreement with the faith (Romans 12:6).

Not the least of their errors was to take away our authority to judge doctrine for ourselves. The false idea that we owe obedience to the pope and councils without question is a heart-breaking affliction which began at a definite point in history.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY VIII - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+119%3A105-112&version=ESV">PSALM 119:105-112</a></p><p>Even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to that which we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you received, let him be accursed. Galatians 1:8-9</p><p>In regard to God’s Word, you must reach the point when you say, “That is how matters stand; no one will ever move me from my stand on God’s Word.” When you hear the Word say, “You shall not kill,” or “Whatever you wish that men would do to you, do so to them,” then you must know that this is Christ’s doctrine over against the decisions of all the councils, even though all men say otherwise.</p><p>This is also the case with the doctrine that we cannot help ourselves in the matter of our salvation but must look to Christ as our Savior who, by His suffering and death, has obtained the forgiveness of sins for us. This doctrine you must know and confess in your heart as the truth.</p><p>If this is not your conviction, you do not have the Christian faith. You may have the Word hanging on your ears or on the tip of your tongue like froth on the water, as Hosea says that Samaria has “her king cut off as foam upon the water” (Hosea 10:7, A.V.). You must believe God’s Word, not just as though it is made up of words preached by Peter, but as a Word which God has commanded you to believe.</p><p>I say all this so that we should return once again to the Gospel and note from what fountain the foundation of our faith flows and to remind you that you have the authority to pronounce judgement on all that is set before you. I do not build my faith on any man and should not do so. I must answer for myself when I am confronted by death.</p><p>SL 11:1397 (11)</p><p>PRAYER: The truth of Your Word, O God, is a sure and certain guide for us in all matters of faith and life. Bestow Your Holy Spirit upon us in such a measure that we understand, believe and confess Your Word, for Christ the Savior’s sake. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

St. Peter and St. Paul did not speak their own words, but God’s Word, as St. Paul also assures the Thessalonians when he says to them, “We also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers.”</p><p>The Word may well be preached to me, but no one can implant it in my heart except God alone.

Hence, no one will ever force me to give up the Word which God Himself has taught me. This I must know as certainly as I know that two and three make five. This remains true even if all councils say otherwise. If they say otherwise, I know that they are lying. Likewise, one yard is more than half a yard; this is certain. Even if the whole world says otherwise, I know that this does not change such facts. Who forces me to this conclusion? No one but the truth alone, which is so complete and so certain that no one can deny it.</p><p>This is also the case with the truth which God has implanted in our hearts.

This authority was filched from us by false Christians for something like a thousand years, so that we had no authority to pronounce judgement on any doctrine but simply had to accept, without expressing any judgment, whatever the pope and the councils determined.</p><p>This Gospel completely overthrows the papacy and all councils. We are not obliged to accept what the pope enjoins or what men set up. Therefore, I say once more, take careful note of this Gospel. Neither the pope nor the councils have received the command to set up and determine what faith is. Christ says here, “Beware of false prophets.” Either the Gospel must be lying, or the pope with the councils.</p><p>Christ tells us that, as Christians, we have the right to judge all doctrine and what has been set up for us to hold or not to hold. Christ is not speaking only to the pope but to all Christians. Just as Christ’s former words are spoken to all, “Whatever you wish that men would do to you, do so to them” (verse 12), so also these words exclude no one, “Beware of false prophets.” From these words it is quite clear that I have the right and duty to judge doctrine.</p><p>Hence, I am obliged to say here, “Pope, you and your councils have made decisions. I now have to judge whether I can accept these decisions or not, for you will not be at my side to answer for me when I have to die. So, I have to see to it where I stand, and I must be sure of my ground.”</p><p>SL 11:1394 (3-5)</p><p>PRAYER: Heavenly Father, Your Word is the truth, and You have given us full and ready access to this Word of truth. Grant us a sure and certain understanding of Your Word, that we may always stand fast in our faith and openly confess the truth of Your Word, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

      <title>Week of Trinity VII - Friday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY VII - FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROMANS+12%3A1-8&version=ESV">ROMANS 12:1-8</a></p><p>Christ ... suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. 1 Peter 2:21</p><p>In the Gospels, we are taught both faith and love. Christ is portrayed to us from two viewpoints: from the viewpoint of faith, that we should repose our whole faith and trust in Him and not indulge in anxious care and worry; and from the viewpoint of love. Just as He does to us in His concern for us, feeding us, giving us drink, and clothing us out of free love alone—and not just to be useful to us or as a reward for our merits—so also, we should do good freely to our neighbors, so that, just as He is Christ for us, we should also be Christ for them.</p><p>Here we see that many of the works performed in times past by the religious are vain and even damned. For they were not performed in the interests of the neighbor, but for the sole reason of piling up personal merits before God.</p><p>True Christian works must never be done with any ulterior motive; they must always be quite free, so that they redound to our neighbor’s welfare and are a completely free gift to him. They are, so to say, thrown into a common pool from which anyone can draw.</p><p>This is what Christ Himself did. He threw all His benefits into a common pool. He gave His doctrine, Word, and life to the congregation as His free gift to them. Blessed are those who accept this gift of Christ with thanksgiving.</p><p>SL 11:1372 (15-16)</p><p>PRAYER: Shine in our darkened hearts and lives with Your Holy Spirit, Lord Jesus, that we may learn to love others as You have loved us, and that, as You are Christ for us, we may also be Christ for them. Grant us this for Your mercy, truth, and love’s sake. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY VII - FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROMANS+12%3A1-8&version=ESV">ROMANS 12:1-8</a></p><p>Christ ... suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. 1 Peter 2:21</p><p>In the Gospels, we are taught both faith and love. Christ is portrayed to us from two viewpoints: from the viewpoint of faith, that we should repose our whole faith and trust in Him and not indulge in anxious care and worry; and from the viewpoint of love. Just as He does to us in His concern for us, feeding us, giving us drink, and clothing us out of free love alone—and not just to be useful to us or as a reward for our merits—so also, we should do good freely to our neighbors, so that, just as He is Christ for us, we should also be Christ for them.</p><p>Here we see that many of the works performed in times past by the religious are vain and even damned. For they were not performed in the interests of the neighbor, but for the sole reason of piling up personal merits before God.</p><p>True Christian works must never be done with any ulterior motive; they must always be quite free, so that they redound to our neighbor’s welfare and are a completely free gift to him. They are, so to say, thrown into a common pool from which anyone can draw.</p><p>This is what Christ Himself did. He threw all His benefits into a common pool. He gave His doctrine, Word, and life to the congregation as His free gift to them. Blessed are those who accept this gift of Christ with thanksgiving.</p><p>SL 11:1372 (15-16)</p><p>PRAYER: Shine in our darkened hearts and lives with Your Holy Spirit, Lord Jesus, that we may learn to love others as You have loved us, and that, as You are Christ for us, we may also be Christ for them. Grant us this for Your mercy, truth, and love’s sake. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication. For an alternate English translation of this sermon, see Lenker, Church Postil—Gospels, 4:202-210.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY VII - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+33%3A8-22&version=ESV">PSALM 33:8-22</a></p><p>“I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat; and if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come a long way.” Mark 8:2-3</p><p>What a friend we have in Jesus! He is even concerned about the welfare of those despicable stomachs of ours. Our hopes must be aroused, and we must certainly find comfort in Christ’s words regarding the multitude on this occasion. They have been waiting upon Him for three days with nothing to eat, and Christ is determined to meet their needs. Here you see that all those who cling steadfastly to God’s Word are fed by God Himself. Here we have an example of the true nature and power of faith; it flows solely from God’s Word.</p><p>Hence, my dear friends, let us really make a beginning of believing. Unbelief is the overall reason for all the sin and vice which has gained the upper hand in all social ranks in our day. How does it come about that there are so many silly women and rogues everywhere, so many traitors, thieves, robbers, usurers, murderers, and those who have ecclesiastical livings for sale? All this results from unbelief. All these people form their judgements on human reason alone. Reason follows nothing but what it can see, and what it cannot see it cannot comprehend. And so, reason cannot comprehend how ultimately, by refusing to place its trust in God through faith, it must end in self-despair in the presence of so many rascals and scoundrels. This is what results where men allow reasons to assume all controls and shut out faith in God.</p><p>SL 11:1371 (13-14)</p><p>PRAYER: Lord of all power and might, the author and giver of all good things, graft in our hearts true love of Your name. Increase in us true religion, nourish us with true goodness, and, of Your great mercy, ever keep us in the same, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

Hebrews 11:1</p><p>Here the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews reminds us that faith is the basis on which we rely for blessings which we do not yet see, or, in other words, I must wait for a blessing that I can neither see nor hear but can only hope for.</p><p>This was also the situation in the Gospel (for this week, Mark 8:1-9). Here we have a large group of men, almost four thousand of them, who with their wives and children have been with Jesus and His disciples for three days with nothing to eat. This was real fasting—I would have you understand. They are now hungry, far from home, and without the necessary provisions to sustain themselves. The writer of Hebrews says that faith is an assurance whereby I hope for blessings that I cannot see. This is the kind of faith that we find here in this multitude: they see no food at all, but they still hope that God will sustain them.</p><p>What does Jesus do here? What attitude does He take in this business? It would almost seem that He has no clues at all, for He goes to the apostles and asks them what to do about the problem of feeding these people. Their reply is characteristic enough, “How can one feed these men with bread here in the desert?” Here we see how human reason and faith not infrequently walk along together. We see that the smarter human reason is, the less it is in line with the works of God.</p><p>Jesus put His question to the disciples so that each of them should learn and recognize from the way his own reason reacted, that there is really no way in which reason and faith can be brought together. Here we learn that, as soon as faith begins, reason must be shut out from that time or granted “leave of absence.”</p><p>SL 11:1368 (6-7)</p><p>PRAYER: Loving Father, on whose bountiful providence we wholly depend, give us at Your pleasure whatever necessities this life requires.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY VII - SUNDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MARK+8%3A1-9&version=ESV">MARK 8:1-9</a></p><p>The law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. John 1:17</p><p>Scripture holds up a twofold picture before us: a picture of fear, that is, a picture of the boundless and strict wrath of God before which no one can stand the test, a picture which would mean utter despair for every one of us if we did not have faith. Over against this, the picture of grace is held up before us, so that faith should regard it very closely and draw from it a friendly, comforting confidence, with the hope that we can never overestimate God’s goodness towards us. There is always still much more with Him.</p><p>You have often heard that there are two kinds of blessings: spiritual and bodily. This Gospel (Mark 8:1-9) deals with temporal and bodily blessings. It teaches us children’s faith; it is a Gospel for the weak.</p><p>In this Gospel, we are taught to look to God as the source of all good and to learn to trust Him. From our experience of God’s blessings in the temporal sphere we should also learn to trust Him in regard to spiritual blessings. This Gospel reminds us of the fact that Christ does look after our bodily needs. From this we may well infer that He also wants to nourish our soul with spiritual blessings.</p><p>If I am not prepared to entrust the sustenance of my body to Him, I will be much less disposed to entrust the eternal welfare of my soul to Him. If I cannot trust a man to give me one florin, how can I trust him to give me ten? If I cannot look to someone for a piece of bread, much less can I entertain any hope that he will give me house and home and a whole estate.</p><p>SL 11:1367 (2-3)</p><p>PRAYER: Heavenly Father, source of everything that is good for our bodies and souls, continue to pour Your good blessings upon us in accordance with the promises and assurances You have given us in and through Christ, our Savior. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY VI - SATURDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROMANS+8%3A1-9&version=ESV">ROMANS 8:1-9</a></p><p>“Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfill them.” Matthew 5:17</p><p>What are we to learn from Christ’s interpretation of the Law in His Sermon on the Mount? First, you should learn that if you were to be judged by your obedience to the Law, you would have to be condemned as a child of sin and the devil. From this lost condition you cannot possibly rescue yourself by your own resources. You have no alternative but to seek refuge in God and beseech Him to change you. Otherwise, all is lost, and you are ruined.</p><p>Therefore, take hold of God’s Word and promises that He is willing to change you, and this will prove itself a source of great help to you. Say to God, “See here, my God, you have set up Christ, your beloved Son, as an example for me. You want me to live as He did. I cannot do this. Change me, dear God, and grant me your peace.”</p><p>God comes to our assistance and says, “Because you acknowledge your need of help and seek grace from Me, I will change you and make a new man of you. And though you are not perfect like Christ, as you should be, My Son’s life and perfection shall come to your assistance.” There must always be something to humble us and inspire us with healthy fear.</p><p>This is real comfort—depending not on our own ability but on the fact that we have a gracious God who forgives us and on our faith in Christ, not on our own “worthiness.” This also purifies us from day to day, and, wherever there is something still lacking, we trust in Christ to provide us with adequate consolation. This is also the chief thrust of this particular Gospel (Matthew 5:20-26).</p><p>SL 11:1350 (11-12)</p><p>PRAYER: Thanks be to you, Lord Jesus Christ, for the hope of salvation which You have provided in the perfect fulfillment of Your heavenly Father’s Law for us, which you offer us in Your Gospel of salvation, for Your mercy and truth’s sake. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY VI - WEDNESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+PETER+1%3A22-25&version=ESV">1 PETER 1:22-25</a></p><p>Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 1 John 3:15</p><p>It is quite clear from Christ’s interpretation in this Gospel that we are all guilty of breaking the commandment, “You shall not kill.”</p><p>He who is not born again from God cannot possibly ever throw off the charge of murder. Even though a man refrains from the act of murder, he cannot get rid of his murderous thoughts and his acquiescence in a murder. How often do we not say when someone is murdered, “He got his deserts! It served him right!” All such reactions are clearly contrary to this commandment. God does not merely consider external works; He looks into the heart. And so, this commandment, “You shall not kill,” is a very wide-reaching commandment with a very wide application.</p><p>Without spiritual rebirth, it is beyond us. Here, too, it is necessary to become a new creature. Christ has fulfilled the whole Law for us by His perfect obedience to His heavenly Father in life and in death. He has “redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us—for it is written, ‘Cursed be everyone who hangs on a tree’” (Galatians 3:13).</p><p>By faith in Christ, all our sins against God’s law are fully and freely forgiven. For our sakes, God made Him to be sin who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness which avails before God in Him. By faith in Christ, we become new creatures, we are born again, and we love to run the way of God’s commandment. But even as new creatures we are still far from perfection. We must always remain linked with Christ or else we must surely fail.</p><p>SL 11:1339 (10-11)</p><p>PRAYER: Renew us by Your Holy Spirit, O God, that we may begin to love Your holy Law and observe it in our relations with our neighbor as new creatures in and through Christ our Savior.

What man on this earth is not guilty of breaking this commandment? What will we do now in the face of the necessity of keeping this commandment while not being able to do so? We cannot sweep away the mire. We are faced with despair and must judge ourselves accordingly.

This I not only attested here by the Lord; it is also proved in every man’s experience and feelings. Christ here touches on four areas: thoughts, gestures or signs, words, and deeds.

We must carefully note what God’s Word actually says to us in the commandment, “You shall not kill.” Who is meant by “you”? The hand? No! The tongue? No! He means “you,” with all that you are and all that is in you. Your hand, your heart, your thoughts shall not kill.</p><p>SL 11:1337 (5-6)</p><p>PRAYER: Dear Father in heaven, even our best efforts to render Your Law the obedience it deserves fall far short of the mark of perfection.

      <title>Week of Trinity V - Saturday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY V - SATURDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+CORINTHIANS+5%3A11-15&version=ESV">2 CORINTHIANS 5:11-15</a></p><p>“Do not be afraid; henceforth you will be catching men.” Luke 5:10</p><p>This is an evangelical word by which weak hearts may obtain consolation. We have seen in this Gospel how God looks after our bodily needs. He provided Peter with so many fish when he would have probably had enough with two or so. God also fills Peter so richly spiritually that he should have enough also in this respect to share it with others. He makes Peter a fisherman both bodily and spiritually. In a bodily manner, Peter catches so many fish that he can sell them; spiritually, however, he is to become a fisher of men, for he has the Gospel with which he is to bring in others and extend the kingdom of Christ.</p><p>When men come to faith, God gives them so much that they are in a position to help all men, outwardly with their property and goods, and from their spiritual resources they are equipped to teach others and make them rich inwardly. When men come to faith, they must proclaim it to others and tell other of their experiences.</p><p>The psalmist knew all about this when he wrote, “Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with a willing spirit. Then I will teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners will return to thee” (Psalm 51:10-13).</p><p>When I believe, I come to know God. Then I also see what others are lacking and proceed to proclaim the Gospel to them. I am in a position as a believer to feed the hungry both bodily and spiritually.</p><p>SL 11:1312 (21-23)</p><p>PRAYER: Thanks and praise be Yours, heavenly Father, for the riches of both bodily and spiritual blessings which You continue to shower upon us.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY V - SATURDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+CORINTHIANS+5%3A11-15&version=ESV">2 CORINTHIANS 5:11-15</a></p><p>“Do not be afraid; henceforth you will be catching men.” Luke 5:10</p><p>This is an evangelical word by which weak hearts may obtain consolation. We have seen in this Gospel how God looks after our bodily needs. He provided Peter with so many fish when he would have probably had enough with two or so. God also fills Peter so richly spiritually that he should have enough also in this respect to share it with others. He makes Peter a fisherman both bodily and spiritually. In a bodily manner, Peter catches so many fish that he can sell them; spiritually, however, he is to become a fisher of men, for he has the Gospel with which he is to bring in others and extend the kingdom of Christ.</p><p>When men come to faith, God gives them so much that they are in a position to help all men, outwardly with their property and goods, and from their spiritual resources they are equipped to teach others and make them rich inwardly. When men come to faith, they must proclaim it to others and tell other of their experiences.</p><p>The psalmist knew all about this when he wrote, “Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with a willing spirit. Then I will teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners will return to thee” (Psalm 51:10-13).</p><p>When I believe, I come to know God. Then I also see what others are lacking and proceed to proclaim the Gospel to them. I am in a position as a believer to feed the hungry both bodily and spiritually.</p><p>SL 11:1312 (21-23)</p><p>PRAYER: Thanks and praise be Yours, heavenly Father, for the riches of both bodily and spiritual blessings which You continue to shower upon us. Grant us the insights to use all these blessings to relieve the needs of our neighbors and for the glory of Your kingdom, in Jesus’ name. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY V - FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+143&version=ESV">PSALM 143</a></p><p>If thou, O Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand? But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. Psalm 130:3-4</p><p>When you feel your sins and become like Peter with a desire to run away from God, you must turn around and get closer and closer to Him. For if God were disposed to flee from you and were not willing to take away your sins, He would never have come to you or pursued you. Therefore, the more you feel that you are a sinner, and the more you want to run away from God, the more importunately you should seek Him.</p><p>Mark this well! For as St. Peter reacted here, so all consciences react in fear because of their sins, trying to escape from God and seeking some false god. Do not end your struggle like this. You cannot possibly end it like this. Present a bold front and cling to God. Otherwise, when you run off in search of works to seek help with another god, and then later want to come back to the true God, you may well have the same experience that the foolish virgins had after going off to buy oil for their lamps, returning only to find the doors locked (Matthew 25:10).</p><p>But what did Jesus do after Peter had humbled himself to such an extent that, in great fear and terror, he requested the Lord to depart from him? Did He allow Peter to remain in his despondency? By no means! He proceeded to comfort Peter with the words, “Do not be afraid; henceforth you will be catching men” (Luke 5:10).</p><p>SL 11:1311 (18-20)</p><p>PRAYER: It is Your assurance, heavenly Father, that the more we feel our sins, the nearer we always are to the forgiveness of sins. Keep us ever steadfast in our faith and hope that You will help and save us, in and through our Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

Luke 5:8-9</p><p>We may take Peter here as an example of those who are to believe in the eternal blessings and actually see them. A sinful conscience is by nature so constituted that it does what Peter does here, it flees from its Savior and thinks, “I am not worthy of being saved and sitting among the saints and angels. The experience of all this good is too much for me.” The straitened conscience cannot comprehend the greatest of blessings but thinks as follows, “If I were like St. Peter or St. Paul, I might be able to believe it all.”</p><p>This is all very foolish, for if you wanted to take your stand on your own holiness, you would be building on sand. Do not do this but follow St. Peter. In regarding himself quite unworthy of such grace, he is really proving his worthiness.</p><p>It is just because you are a sinner, and realize this fact, that you must trust yourself entirely to God’s grace. You must open up your conscience to its widest extent and let your heart swell so that grace may enter in.</p><p>SL 11:131 (16)</p><p>PRAYER: We thank and praise You, heavenly Father, for Your friendly approach to us sinners and for the wonderful riches of Your goodness toward us. May this ever be an incentive and an invitation to us to draw even closer to You and readily accept Your grace whenever it is offered to us. In Jesus’ name, we ask it.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY V - MONDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=LUKE+12%3A13-21&version=ESV">LUKE 12:13-21</a></p><p>Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly, I say to you, it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again, I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” Matthew 19:23-24</p><p>Paul gives a vivid description of what happens when men give way to unbelief (1 Timothy 6:6-10). The man who is solely bent on piling up earthly possessions and becoming rich falls into temptations and snares of the devil. This cannot be seen; it is something spiritual. If we could really see the damage that the devil does in spiritual things in the same degree that we can see the damage he does in bodily matters, we would really have something to preach about. For we have external evidence of how an unbelieving man keeps on scraping earthly property together, doing violence to every man so that he may have no opposition and stand alone in his scraping operations so that finally he may rely on what he has scraped together and say: “Now I have enough.”</p><p>What a mean and unfriendly thing this unbelief is! It does no one any good; it is friendly to no one; it considers nothing but its own advantage. It is certainly an accursed thing, this unbelief, refusing to trust God for the sake of our benefit and actually believing that, if we do not adopt all possible methods and procedures for ensuring our bodily welfare, even at the expense of our neighbor’s welfare, we will die of hunger.</p><p>SL 11:1306 (4-5)</p><p>PRAYER: Lord, You have shown us in very clear precept and example that we should never be greedy and covetous, but contented and generous. Fill our hearts with such trust in Your wonderful care and providence that we overcome all temptations to selfishness and use our blessings to help all in need, for Your name’s sake. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

Our earthly property should always be at the disposal of our neighbor. We should lend to our neighbor and give to him where and when he wills it.</p><p>These are real commandments and not merely counsels, as has sometimes been suggested. Jesus does not mean here, “He who wants to attain perfection must follow this course.” In an effort to observe this counsel of perfection, men withdrew from the world into monasteries, seeking this perfection. For this reason alone, all monasteries are a devil’s delusion.

If you are wrongfully deprived of something, do not demand it again for yourself. Let your neighbor step forth on your behalf and help you, so that you do not have to suffer excessively. Your neighbor should help you and protect you against wrong and violence. If you want to be Christians, you must lend and give and even suffer the deprivation of your goods, or your faith will be lacking.</p><p>SL 11:1279 (20-21)</p><p>PRAYER: You have given us everything, O God.

      <title>Week of Trinity IV - Thursday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY IV - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JAMES+2%3A14-17&version=ESV">JAMES 2:14-17</a></p><p>Brethren, be the more zealous to confirm your call and election, for if you do this you will never fall; so there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 2 Peter 1:10-11</p><p>Good works should always be a sure sign to me, resembling a seal on a letter, to make me certain that my faith is right. If I feel in my heart that a certain work has flowed from the love in my heart, I can be certain that my faith is as it should be. If I forgive, my forgiveness should assure me that my own faith is a living reality. It guarantees and proves my own faith that God has forgiven me and forgives me daily. But if I do not forgive, I should quickly have to conclude that there is something lacking in my faith.</p><p>This was also Abraham’s experience. Works made his own faith known to him. God certainly knew that he had faith, but Abraham also had to know this and prove his faith.</p><p>Works are therefore the fruits and proof which freely follow faith. Of what use would it be to me if I had a strong faith but did not know it? It would be like having a chest full of florins and not knowing it. This would be of no use to me. But if someone made this known to me, his service to me would seem like a gift.</p><p>So also with faith. If I have faith and do not know it, it is of no use to me. Therefore, it must break forth and become known to me by the works which follow it.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY IV - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JAMES+2%3A14-17&version=ESV">JAMES 2:14-17</a></p><p>Brethren, be the more zealous to confirm your call and election, for if you do this you will never fall; so there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 2 Peter 1:10-11</p><p>Good works should always be a sure sign to me, resembling a seal on a letter, to make me certain that my faith is right. If I feel in my heart that a certain work has flowed from the love in my heart, I can be certain that my faith is as it should be. If I forgive, my forgiveness should assure me that my own faith is a living reality. It guarantees and proves my own faith that God has forgiven me and forgives me daily. But if I do not forgive, I should quickly have to conclude that there is something lacking in my faith.</p><p>This was also Abraham’s experience. Works made his own faith known to him. God certainly knew that he had faith, but Abraham also had to know this and prove his faith.</p><p>Works are therefore the fruits and proof which freely follow faith. Of what use would it be to me if I had a strong faith but did not know it? It would be like having a chest full of florins and not knowing it. This would be of no use to me. But if someone made this known to me, his service to me would seem like a gift.</p><p>So also with faith. If I have faith and do not know it, it is of no use to me. Therefore, it must break forth and become known to me by the works which follow it. Peter urges us to do good works, not that we should thereby be called, but to confirm our call and offer proof of it.</p><p>SL 11:1277 (16-17)</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, heavenly Father, endow us with a true, living faith which always proves itself in works of love to our neighbor, for the Savior’s sake. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY IV - WEDNESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+CORINTHIANS+6%3A1-2&version=ESV">2 CORINTHIANS 6:1-2</a></p><p>What have you that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if it were not a gift? I Corinthians 4:7</p><p>We must always receive before we can give. Before we practice mercy, we must receive mercy from God. We never lay the first stone. The sheep does not seek out the shepherd, but the shepherd the sheep.</p><p>See to it, then, that you always keep works in their proper place. You do not obtain anything from God by your works. You obtain all that you receive from God without any merit or worthiness on your part at all, as God says to us in Isaiah, “I was ready to be sought by those who did not ask for me; I was ready to be found by those who did not seek me” (Isaiah 65:1). At the end of the same chapter, God says, “Before they call, I will answer; while they are yet speaking, I will hear” (Isaiah 65:24). Before we seek Him, He finds us; before we ask after Him, He already hears us.</p><p>This is also what Paul says in the famous section of Romans, “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, they are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as an expiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins; it was to prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justified him who has faith in Jesus” (Romans 3:23-26).</p><p>Paul explains it all very neatly when he says later on in Romans, “If it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise, grace would no longer be grace” (Romans 11:6).</p><p>SL 11:1276 (15)</p><p>PRAYER: O God our Father, let us find mercy in Your sight so that we have grace to serve You acceptably with due reverence and godly fear, and further grace not to receive Your undeserved love in vain or to neglect it or fall away from it, but to stir us up to grow up in it and persevere therein, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.” John 15:4-5</p><p>Someone may wonder how we can reconcile what Jesus teaches in this Gospel with our frequent contention that works count for nothing with God and play no part at all in obtaining a favorable judgement from Him. How does it come to pass that the very opposite seems to be set forth by Christ in this Gospel? Christ says, “Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful. Judge not, and you will not be judged; condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven; give, and it will be given to you” (Luke 6:36-38).</p><p>The gist of all these statements seems to be that we must gain God’s favor for ourselves by means of our works, and that by our works we must win God over so that He is merciful to us and forgives us. We, on the other hand, have always been most emphatic in insisting that it is faith alone that achieves all this.</p><p>Note well, then, that St. Paul, with the whole testimony of Scripture oft-repeated on his side, insists on the necessity of faith, that we must have dealings with God through pure faith alone. Hence, you must understand passages like the ones which we have here in our Gospel as teaching that works are the proof and verification of faith. If I have faith, then I must be merciful, refrain from judging and condemning, forgive and give to my neighbor.</p><p>SL 11:1275 (13-14)</p><p>PRAYER: Grant us your grace, O God, that we may always demonstrate the genuineness of our faith in abundant works of mercy towards our neighbor for Christ’s sake.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY III - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW+18%3A10-14&version=ESV">MATTHEW 18:10-14</a></p><p>He told them this parable: “What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one which is lost, until he finds it? And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.’ … Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it? And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I had lost.’” Luke 15:3-6, 8-9</p><p>Christ is the shepherd, and He is also the woman. It is Christ who has lit the lamp, that is, the Gospel, and it is Christ who walks about in the wilderness, that is, the world, and who sweeps the house seeking the lost sheep and the lost coin. He does this seeking with His Word so that, first of all, sin is proclaimed to us and, thereafter, grace and mercy.</p><p>When we are told here that the shepherd takes up the lost sheep on His shoulders, the reference is to the fact that our sin has been laid on Christ’s shoulders. This certainly must strengthen our confidence in Christ, and this must also follow from the way in which tax collectors and other sinners flocked to Him and were received by Him. Had they regarded him as nothing but a stubborn judge, they would never have come to Him. But these sinners recognized themselves as sinners in need of His grace. And when they heard tell of His attractive words, they came to Him.</p><p>Learn from this that we should seek out our neighbor to cover his shame with our honor and to hide his sin with our piety.</p><p>SL 11:1239 (15-16)</p><p>PRAYER: It is not Your will, O Lord, that we should ever delight in the sins of others and gloat over them, but that we should rather help them to repentance and provide joy in heaven. Fix this truth in our hearts in such a way that we always act according to it, for the sake of Jesus our Savior. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

Inwardly, in our heart, we must be prepared to serve them; outwardly, with the tongue, we should also instruct them in all earnestness.</p><p>This is what God expects of us, and this is also what Jesus, the captain of our salvation, has demonstrated for us. St. Paul also makes this quite plan to us when he says in his Epistle to the Philippians, “Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. Have this mind among yourselves, which you have in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form He humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross” (Philippians 2:4-8).</p><p>Christ was absolutely perfect in all righteousness, and He could have simply condemned all of us. But He does not do this. What does he do? He gives Himself to us as our servant. His righteousness served our sins; His perfection made up for our frailty; His life conquered our death.</p><p>We see this also quite clearly in this Gospel from Christ’s friendly attitude towards sinners, which made the Pharisees murmur.</p><p>SL 11:1238 (13-14)</p><p>PRAYER: As Your disciples, Lord Jesus, the interests of others are our interests. It is Your clearly expressed will that we should always concern ourselves with the interests of others.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY III - TUESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW+9%3A10-13&version=ESV">MATTHEW 9:10-13</a></p><p>“This man receives sinners and eats with them.” Luke 15:2</p><p>To help assist sinners in finding the true way out of their sins and to conquer sin are the really important and significant works in which we Christians should train ourselves. But not many are concerned about these works; most people by-pass them. The practice has died out and, to a large extent, become extinct. In preference, following the devil, one man goes to St. James; another builds a church; a third man establishes a mass. One man does this, another that. No one ever seems to think of making intercession for sinners.

Help him up, dear God!” In this way you would be receiving a sinner with Jesus and serving him.</p><p>This is what Moses did when the Jews worshipped the molten calf. He became wrapped up in this sin and reproached them for it in all severity. Three thousand men were put to death when the avenging sword passed from gate to gate on this occasion (Exodus 32:27-28). But in the end Moses fell down before God and interceded with God to forgive them their sin or blot him out of the book of life (Exodus 32:32). This was a man who knew that God loved him and had written his name in His book of life. But Moses said, “Lord, I would prefer it if you condemned me and forgave the people their sin.” We have another example of this concern for sinners in the apostle Paul (Romans 9:3).</p><p>SL 11:1237 (8-9)</p><p>PRAYER: Lord Jesus, Your readiness to receive sinners and to help them with Your grace and forgiveness has been made very plain to us in Your Gospel. Grant us such a clear understanding of Your Word and mission that we always manifest a similar concern for sinners and do our utmost to make known to them the help available in Your Gospel. In Your name we ask it. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

Luke 15:1-2</p><p>In our Gospel, two groups are set before us as an example and for our instruction. First of all, there are the Pharisees and hypocrites. These people were regarded as models of perfection in respect to all kinds of piety and godliness. They were immersed in holiness over their ears.

These people should also be invited to the banquet and compelled to come in. The reference, however, is not to any external compulsion but to an inner, spiritual compulsion.</p><p>This results when the Law is preached and sin is disclosed and brought to light, so that a man comes to realize what he really is. He is brought under compulsion, compelled to come in, when a vivid knowledge of sin is stirred up in his conscience. As a result of this, he also realizes that he is nothing in God’s sight, that all his works are sinful and even condemnatory.

In this wretched condition he is finally led to despair.</p><p>When a man has been brought under compulsion in this way, you should not delay with the invitation to “come in” and help him out of this despondency. This is achieved when you comfort him with the Gospel, telling him how he has been freed from his sins with the words, “Believe in Christ, that He has freed you from your sins and you will be rid of your sins.” This is what is meant in this Gospel by compelling men to come in so that the householder’s home may be filled.</p><p>SL 11:1214 (12-13)</p><p>PRAYER: Lord, you have reminded us in a very vivid manner that we are always confronted with a situation of grave urgency respecting our invitation to men to come in and partake of the banquet prepared for them in your kingdom of grace.

      <title>Week of Trinity II - Friday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY II - FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JOHN+10%3A14-16&version=ESV">JOHN 10:14-16</a></p><p>“Then the householder in anger said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city and bring in the poor and maimed and blind and lame.’” Luke 14:21</p><p>The householder’s instruction to his servant to go out quickly “to the streets and lanes of the city” refers to the fact that the Jews proved themselves unworthy of the Gospel and turned away from it. As a result of this, the disciples of Christ turned to the Gentiles. Before His resurrection, Christ instructed His disciples not to turn to the Gentiles or to preach in the cities of the Samaritans. They were too busy themselves only with the sheep of the house of Israel and to pasture them. This they also did.</p><p>But later, after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, when the Jews opposed Christ’s Word of salvation and refused to accept it, the apostles told the Jews, “It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken first to you.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY II - FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JOHN+10%3A14-16&version=ESV">JOHN 10:14-16</a></p><p>“Then the householder in anger said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city and bring in the poor and maimed and blind and lame.’” Luke 14:21</p><p>The householder’s instruction to his servant to go out quickly “to the streets and lanes of the city” refers to the fact that the Jews proved themselves unworthy of the Gospel and turned away from it. As a result of this, the disciples of Christ turned to the Gentiles. Before His resurrection, Christ instructed His disciples not to turn to the Gentiles or to preach in the cities of the Samaritans. They were too busy themselves only with the sheep of the house of Israel and to pasture them. This they also did.</p><p>But later, after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, when the Jews opposed Christ’s Word of salvation and refused to accept it, the apostles told the Jews, “It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles. For so the Lord has commanded us” (Acts 13:46-47). The apostles then quoted a passage from the prophet Isaiah, “I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth” (Isaiah 49:6).</p><p>The same instruction is given by the householder to the servant here in this Gospel: “Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city and bring in the poor and maimed and blind and lame. Go out to the highways and hedges and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled” (Luke 14:21, 23).</p><p>SL 11:1214 (11)</p><p>PRAYER: O God, in your great mercy and grace you have given us the good news of salvation in your Son Jesus Christ. Fill our hearts with thankfulness so that we may tell abroad the glad tidings which we have received, through the same Jesus Christ our Lord.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY II - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=LUKE+14%3A25-33&version=ESV">LUKE 14:25-33</a></p><p>He called to him the multitude with his disciples, and said to them, “If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel’s will save it.” Mark 8:34-35</p><p>He who gives up something for the Gospel really loses nothing. Even if you lose your earthly life for Christ’s sake, He will give you another, better life, eternal life, as Christ Himself says: “He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it” (Matthew 10:39). If you have to leave child and wife, remember that God can take care of them and be a much better father to them than you have ever been. There is no doubt at all about this. Believe it with all your heart!</p><p>You have equally great assurance, together with rich promises and encouragement, that He will never fall down on His Word. He will keep His Word, as we shall also discover if we are ready to put our trust in it and to resign ourselves to it. He has given us His Word and promised; what more could we want, or what could we desire that is greater?</p><p>Is something lacking? Only in our faith. Let no one come to this banquet unless he comes with a thorough-going faith which exalts God above all creatures and loves Him above all else.</p><p>SL 11:1213 (10)</p><p>PRAYER: Almighty God, so reign in our heart and soul that Christ may always have dominion there.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY II - SUNDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=LUKE+14%3A16-21&version=ESV">LUKE 14:16-21</a></p><p>“A man once gave a great banquet.” Luke 14:16</p><p>In this Gospel, as well as in the remainder of Holy Scripture, we must make an effort, to the best of our ability, to grasp the true, simple meaning of the text and to rest our heart and conscience on it. Anyone who wants to do battle with the devil must not waver to and fro or totter, but must be sure of his ground, armed with clear and certain Scripture. Otherwise, when the devil gets him on to his fork by means of an unsure understanding, he will toss him to and fro like the wind tosses a dry leaf.</p><p>In this Gospel we must also obtain a sure understanding so that we may stand our ground.

It is called a “banquet” or a supper because the Gospel will be the last, final word and doctrine which will bring this world to a close.</p><p>This supper, then, is nothing else but a rich, precious meal, which God has made ready by means of the Gospel, through Christ, in which He sets before us great blessings and rich treasures.</p><p>SL 11:1210 (1-3)</p><p>PRAYER: Lord, You have set before us great blessings and rich treasures in the banquet prepared for us through Your Son and offered to us in Your Gospel.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY I - WEDNESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW+25%3A31-46&version=ESV">MATTHEW 25:31-46</a></p><p>Through love be servants of one another. Galatians 5:13</p><p>One sin follows another. The rich man clothed in purple and faring sumptuously every day forgot his love towards his neighbor. He let poor Lazarus lie at his door and gave him no help. Even if he was disinclined to give Lazarus some help personally, he could still have ordered his servants to make a shed available to him where they could have done something for him.</p><p>This came about because he had no real understanding of God and had never experienced God’s goodness. He who has experienced God’s goodness also has some feeling for his neighbor’s misfortune. But he who has never experienced God’s goodness, also has no feeling for his neighbor’s misfortune. Even as he finds no pleasure in God, so also his neighbor’s plight never touches his heart.</p><p>Faith is so constituted that it looks to God for all that is good and relies on God alone. Out of such faith man learns to know God, how good and gracious He is. From this knowledge of God, man’s heart is also softened and inclined to mercy, so that he readily does for everyone what he feels God has done for him.</p><p>The result of all this is love, by which a man begins to serve his neighbor with his whole heart, with body and life, with property and honor, with soul and spirit. He is ready to bestow everything on his neighbor, as God has done this for him. He does not look for healthy, high, strong, rich, noble, and holy people, who have no need of him, but for the sick, the weak, the poor, the despised people who are sinners, to whom he can be useful. On these he can exercise his mercy and serve them as God has served him.</p><p>SL 11:1197 (7-8)<br />AE 78:57</p><p>PRAYER: Teach us, O Lord, that it is always better to give than to receive, better to serve than to be served, after Your own example, that we may always help our needy neighbor, for Your mercy and truth’s sake. Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY I - WEDNESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW+25%3A31-46&version=ESV">MATTHEW 25:31-46</a></p><p>Through love be servants of one another. Galatians 5:13</p><p>One sin follows another. The rich man clothed in purple and faring sumptuously every day forgot his love towards his neighbor. He let poor Lazarus lie at his door and gave him no help. Even if he was disinclined to give Lazarus some help personally, he could still have ordered his servants to make a shed available to him where they could have done something for him.</p><p>This came about because he had no real understanding of God and had never experienced God’s goodness. He who has experienced God’s goodness also has some feeling for his neighbor’s misfortune. But he who has never experienced God’s goodness, also has no feeling for his neighbor’s misfortune. Even as he finds no pleasure in God, so also his neighbor’s plight never touches his heart.</p><p>Faith is so constituted that it looks to God for all that is good and relies on God alone. Out of such faith man learns to know God, how good and gracious He is. From this knowledge of God, man’s heart is also softened and inclined to mercy, so that he readily does for everyone what he feels God has done for him.</p><p>The result of all this is love, by which a man begins to serve his neighbor with his whole heart, with body and life, with property and honor, with soul and spirit. He is ready to bestow everything on his neighbor, as God has done this for him. He does not look for healthy, high, strong, rich, noble, and holy people, who have no need of him, but for the sick, the weak, the poor, the despised people who are sinners, to whom he can be useful. On these he can exercise his mercy and serve them as God has served him.</p><p>SL 11:1197 (7-8)<br />AE 78:57</p><p>PRAYER: Teach us, O Lord, that it is always better to give than to receive, better to serve than to be served, after Your own example, that we may always help our needy neighbor, for Your mercy and truth’s sake. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY I - TUESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+TIMOTHY+6%3A6-10&version=ESV">1 TIMOTHY 6:6-10</a></p><p>If riches increase, set not your heart on them. Psalm 62:10</p><p>Where there is true Christian faith, rich attire and sumptuous food will never be major considerations. Christian faith does not look for earthly good, honor, pleasure, power, or anything outside of God Himself. It seeks, desires, and clings to nothing but God, who alone is the highest good.</p><p>Whether there is costly fare or little to eat, whether there is splendid attire or nothing but very simple clothing, makes very little difference to Christian faith. Even if Christians must wear costly attire and wield great power in a position of honor, they think little of it. It may be that they have been forced into this by circumstances or that they must adopt such procedures in the interests of their neighbor. Queen Esther declared that she wore her royal crown reluctantly but was compelled to do so for the sake of the king. David would have preferred to remain a common man. He was compelled to become king for God’s sake and the sake of the people.</p><p>This is the way all believers regard their elevated roles in this world. They are compelled to accept power, honor, and glory, but they never allow their roles in life to ensnare their hearts. Basically, they continue to serve God and their neighbor however they may find themselves situated in this life.</p><p>SL 11:1196 (5)<br />AE 78:56-57</p><p>PRAYER: O God, our Father, Your Word is better than gold, and Your counsels are more precious than anything else in life.

It brings no charge against him with which the world or reason could find fault. He was just as honorable in his life as the Pharisee who fasted twice in the week and did not do what other men did, and of whom Luke also writes in his Gospel (18:11-12).

The Gospel can fault works of which reason may approve. Nor is the Gospel fooled by the sheep’s clothing. It knows how to regard the fruit of a tree, whether it is good or bad, as the Lord also says in Matthew’s Gospel, “Every sound tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears evil fruit” (Matthew 7:17).</p><p>SL 11:1195 (2-3)<br />AE 78:55-56</p><p>PRAYER: You can read our hearts, O God, and know what we really are.

From this passage, it is clear that the Holy Spirit is God because the heavens and their host were created through Him.</p><p>David also says, “Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?

No creature is to be found in all corners of the world, and no creature fills the whole world. This can only be affirmed of God, the Creator.</p><p>Accordingly, we stick to the Scriptures and the statements of Scripture which attest the threefold person of God and say, “I know for sure that God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are a living reality, but just how they are truly one I do not know and will never know.”</p><p>SL 11:1151 (10-12)</p><p>PRAYER: Holy, almighty, eternal, divine Spirit, of one authority and dominion with the Father and the Son, set up Your throne in our hearts.

      <title>Week of Trinity - Friday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY - FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW+3%3A13-17&version=ESV">MATTHEW 3:13-17</a></p><p>“This is eternal life, that they know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent.” John 17:3</p><p>You can have no more sure and certain basis for the deity of Christ than to wrap up your heart in clear passages of Scripture and, in this way, also lock up this truth in your hearts.</p><p>Scripture begins in a very gentle manner and introduces us to Christ as a man. Then it brings Him before us as the Lord of all creatures. Finally, we are shown quite clearly and expressly that Christ is God. In this way, fine progress is made, and we learn to recognize God.</p><p>The philosophers and worldly-wise men begin at the top and make fools of themselves in the process. You must begin at the bottom and make your way up so that Solomon’s words are not fulfilled in you: “It is not good to eat too much honey, and he who investigates difficult matters will find the going too hard” (Proverbs 25:27, Luther’s translation).</p><p>Our faith in the two persons of the Father and the Son has been adequately grounded and established on clear passages of Scripture. On the third person, the Holy Spirit, we may well quote Christ’s words on sending out His disciples, “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 28:19).</p><p>Here Christ assigns deity also to the Holy Spirit, inasmuch as I can trust or believe in no one else but God alone. I always need one who is mighty over death, hell, and the devil. He must also be able to rule over all creatures so that they cannot harm me and so that He can always pull me through. I must have one on whom I can freely build. Christ decides that we should believe and trust in the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the Holy Spirit must be God.</p><p>SL 11:1150 (8-9)</p><p>PRAYER: Almighty and everlasting God, in Your mercy You have granted us the faith to acknowledge the glory of the eternal Trinity. Keep us steadfast in this faith which leads us to the salvation which You have prepared for us in and through our Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+8&version=ESV">PSALM 8</a></p><p>He is Lord of lords and King of kings. Revelation 17:14</p><p>In the second psalm, God says to His Son: “Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage and the ends of the earth as your possession” (Psalm 2:8).

      <title>Week of Trinity - Monday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY - MONDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+110%3A1-4&version=ESV">PSALM 110:1-4</a></p><p>He [Christ] reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature. Hebrews 1:3</p><p>The Old Testament sets forth many clear testimonies on the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ. David says: “The Lord says to my lord: ‘Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool.’” The “right hand” means the royal throne, and this passage indicates that David’s “Lord,” Christ, is a Lord and King over all creatures and that everything is to be subjected to Him (Psalm 110:1).</p><p>In another psalm we read: “What is man that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that thou dost care for him? Yet thou hast made him little less than God and dost crown him with glory and honor. Thou hast given him dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, whatever passes along the paths of the sea” (Psalm 8:4-8). In other words, God has made Him Lord over the whole world.</p><p>The apostle Paul refers to this psalm in Ephesians and Colossians and gives a masterly interpretation of it (Ephesians 1:20; Colossians 2:9-10). If God has set Him at His own right hand and made Him Lord of all things in heaven and on earth, He must be God. He could not sit at God’s right hand and have authority over all creatures if He were not God. For God will not share His glory with any else, as He states in Isaiah 48:11.</p><p>So, there are two persons, the Father and the Son, to whom the Father has given as much as He himself has. To sit at God’s right hand means being the equal of God and having authority over all God's creatures. The One to whom this has been assigned must be God.</p><p>SL 11:1148 (4)</p><p>PRAYER: Lord Jesus, as true God together with Your heavenly Father, You are fully worthy of all honor and worship. Open our hearts at all times to the majesty of Your person and the scope of Your authority and power. Grant us this in Your mercy and grace, Lord Jesus, You who live and reign with Your Father and the Spirit, one God, forevermore. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY - MONDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+110%3A1-4&version=ESV">PSALM 110:1-4</a></p><p>He [Christ] reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature. Hebrews 1:3</p><p>The Old Testament sets forth many clear testimonies on the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ. David says: “The Lord says to my lord: ‘Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool.’” The “right hand” means the royal throne, and this passage indicates that David’s “Lord,” Christ, is a Lord and King over all creatures and that everything is to be subjected to Him (Psalm 110:1).</p><p>In another psalm we read: “What is man that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that thou dost care for him? Yet thou hast made him little less than God and dost crown him with glory and honor. Thou hast given him dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, whatever passes along the paths of the sea” (Psalm 8:4-8). In other words, God has made Him Lord over the whole world.</p><p>The apostle Paul refers to this psalm in Ephesians and Colossians and gives a masterly interpretation of it (Ephesians 1:20; Colossians 2:9-10). If God has set Him at His own right hand and made Him Lord of all things in heaven and on earth, He must be God. He could not sit at God’s right hand and have authority over all creatures if He were not God. For God will not share His glory with any else, as He states in Isaiah 48:11.</p><p>So, there are two persons, the Father and the Son, to whom the Father has given as much as He himself has. To sit at God’s right hand means being the equal of God and having authority over all God's creatures. The One to whom this has been assigned must be God.</p><p>SL 11:1148 (4)</p><p>PRAYER: Lord Jesus, as true God together with Your heavenly Father, You are fully worthy of all honor and worship. Open our hearts at all times to the majesty of Your person and the scope of Your authority and power. Grant us this in Your mercy and grace, Lord Jesus, You who live and reign with Your Father and the Spirit, one God, forevermore. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication. For an alternate English translation of this sermon, see Lenker, Church Postil—Gospels, 3:405-411.</p>

      <title>Week of Trinity - Sunday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY - SUNDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JOHN+3%3A1-15&version=ESV">JOHN 3:1-15</a></p><p>The Word was God … And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. John 1:14</p><p>The Sunday after Pentecost has come to be regarded in the Church as the festival of the Holy Trinity. The word Trinity is not found in Holy Scripture; it has been devised and invented by men. That is also why it always sounds a little cold. It would be far better if we simply said “God” in place of the “Trinity.”</p><p>This word signifies that God is threefold with respect to person. This is a heavenly matter which the world cannot understand. That is why I have so often reminded you that this article, as well as others, must not be based on reason or on any human similes or allegories; it must be based and ground on passages of the Scriptures. God Himself knows well what this article means and how He should speak about Himself.</p><p>The theological schools have devised many distinctions, dreams, and fictions in their efforts to set forth the holy Trinity and have made fools of themselves in the effort. In this connection, then, we shall take simple statements of Scripture by which we may grasp and comprehend the deity of Christ.</p><p>To begin, there are many passages to be quoted here from the New Testament. One of the best known of these passages forms the beginning of John’s Gospel, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God; all things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made” (John 1:1-3). Accordingly, since He was not made but was the Maker Himself, He must be very God. And John says a little later, “And the Word became flesh.”</p><p>SL 11:1146 (1-3)</p><p>PRAYER: Worthy of praise from every mouth, of confession from every tongue, and worship from every creature is Your glorious name, O Triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Abide with us, Your unworthy servants, with Your Word and grace, now and forever. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

But the Counsellor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.” John 14:25-26</p><p>If the Holy Spirit is to live up to His name, He cannot carry out His office anywhere else but where there is no counsel or comfort available and where such counsel and comfort is necessary and also desired. The Holy Spirit cannot comfort hard-headed men with frivolous hearts. Such men have never known any kind of inward struggle or tasted the bitter fruits of despair. They have never felt any particular need or spiritual distress, so the Holy Spirit has nothing to offer them. His office can be carried out only among the sorrowful, those in need of comfort, in hearts that are despairing.</p><p>But what is His work? To teach “all things” and bring matters to remembrance that men must know. Some have explained this as meaning that the Scriptures do not contain all that man must believe and do or leave undone. The Holy Spirit’s work is to teach many things that Christ did not teach. This is absolutely against the work of the Holy Spirt and even quite absurd.</p><p>Christ says quite clearly here: “He will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you,” that is, “He will explain clearly what I am now telling you better than I am able to teach you with words. You will need no further words or explanations.”</p><p>Christ bases His Word on the testimony of the Holy Spirit. It is the Holy Spirit’s work to bear witness to Christ, and this testimony of the Spirit lives in our hearts so that we understand it and believe it. Hence, if anyone teaches you something different about Christ, do not accept it as coming from the Holy Spirit.</p><p>SL 11:1029 (29-30)</p><p>PRAYER: Holy Spirit of God, give us a new mind to comprehend the loving purposes of our God and Father, a new heart ever to rejoice in them, and the perseverance which keeps us on the paths of Your will, in Christ’s name.

Galatians 5:25</p><p>There must always be a mixture or blending in us: we must feel both the Holy Spirit and our sin and imperfection. If there is to be improvement in us, we must resemble a sick person in the hands of a physician. Therefore, let no one conclude as follows: this person has the Holy Spirit; therefore, he or she must be quite strong; bring forth the most precious works and never show any signs of weakness. Not so! The Gospel is not a proclamation for everyone.</p><p>It is beyond measure a sweet proclamation, but if it encounters raw and acid hearts, it does not achieve its purpose. In this case, men become only more insolent and frivolous in the belief that there is really no need for them to struggle against sin. They have no real knowledge of sin or misfortune. Therefore, the Holy Spirit is given to no one but to those who are truly sorrowful because of their sins and who are afraid of the consequences.

Even if the latter come by chance upon the Gospel and hear it preached, they simply devour it without knowing what they are devouring. For successful work, the Holy Spirit must encounter hearts which feel and realize their sinful lusts, and which know that by nature they are in a hopeless situation. There must be a struggle in the heart if the Spirit is to come with His help. No one should imagine that things can take another course here.</p><p>SL 11:1027 (23)</p><p>PRAYER: Heavenly Father, You have implanted desires in our hearts so great that only You can bring them to pass.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF PENTECOST - WEDNESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PHILIPPIANS+3%3A12-16&version=ESV">PHILIPPIANS 3:12-16</a></p><p>Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. Philippians 3:12</p><p>We should learn to understand that a man who has received the Holy Spirit does not necessarily become a perfect Christian immediately, experiencing no further trouble from the Law or from sin. Nor is the Spirit’s presence always immediately evident from a spotless purity.</p><p>We do not teach that the Holy Spirit has already fully performed His office and completed it but simply that He has begun to carry out His office, that His work is beginning to run its course and continually developing without ceasing.</p><p>You will never find a single person who is without sin and sorrow, full of righteousness and joy, and so perfect that he is completely self-sufficient, serving everyone in perfect freedom. Scripture clearly tells us what the work and office of the Holy Spirit is, to save men from sin and its terrors, but that office is still not fully accomplished. Every Christian will at times feel sin in his heart and experience the terrors of death. He will be subject to all the assaults which assail other sinners.</p><p>Unbelievers are held so fast in their sins that they no longer feel them. Believers, however, do feel them, but they have a helper, the Holy Spirit, who comforts them and strengthens them. Had the Spirit completed His office, this would not be the case.</p><p>SL 11:1025 (19-20)</p><p>PRAYER: We beseech You, O Lord, to grant us the comforting presence and aid of Your Holy Spirit, that, whatever by His teaching we know to be our duty, we may by His grace and mercy be able to perform, through Christ our Lord.

It is the office of the Holy Spirit to fix this treasure in our hearts as our very own possession.</p><p>When He has done this and you experience this treasure in your heart, it follows that you will have to ask yourself: If the real issue here is that your works count for nothing and that the Holy Spirit must work all this in you, why should you continue to flog yourself with works of the Law?</p><p>All human works and the Law are no longer of any significance here, not even the law of Moses, for a man who has the treasure of Christ in his heart is above all law.

What means does He use to take hold of the heart? He does it by proclaiming and preaching the Lord Jesus Christ, as Christ Himself declares in John’s Gospel, “When the Counsellor comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness to me.”</p><p>We have often heard that this Gospel, which God allows to be preached in the world and proclaimed to everyone, teaches that no one can become righteous before God through the Law, but that the Law only makes the situation worse for every man. Therefore, God sent His beloved Son into the world to die and shed His blood for the world and to demonstrate that men cannot destroy their sins and get rid of them by their own strength and works.</p><p>For the proclamation of this Gospel, something additional is needed. I do not necessarily believe this Gospel simply by hearing it preached. For this purpose, God has given us the additional gift of His Holy Spirit who impresses this Gospel upon our hearts, so that it sticks to the heart and lives in the heart. In the work of Christ, there is the whole treasure of salvation, but it is not necessarily distributed and applied.</p><p>If we are to enjoy this treasure, the Holy Spirit must come to us and put this treasure into our hearts and awaken faith in this treasure in our hearts so that it becomes our very own possession. This is the special work of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>SL. 11:1024 (15-16)</p><p>PRAYER: Almighty and merciful Lord, in the gifts of Your Holy Spirit You have given us a sure pledge that Christ’s work of salvation belongs to us. May Your Holy Spirit always continue to bear witness with our spirit that we are Your children and heirs of Your kingdom, in and through our Savior Jesus Christ.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>ASCENSION WEEK 1 - TUESDAY</p><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW+10%3A24-33%C2%A0&version=ESV">MATTHEW 10:24-33</a></p><p>I am weary with my moaning; every night I flood my bed with tears; I drench my couch with my weeping. My eye wastes away because of grief, it grows weak because of all my foes. Psalm 6:6-7</p><p>The chief requisite for a consistent confession of faith is a firm faith, and it is almost certain that the cross will follow upon a consistent confession of faith. Another experience that we will have, whether in life or in death, is that all that we have done can be represented in such a light that it seems to be opposed to God and Scripture.</p><p>It would be better for us to learn this from men here in this life rather than from the devil in death. For men can never push a matter beyond our ears. But the devil has a very sharp tongue and can push something right into our heart, making it tremble, and filling us with such fear that we imagine ourselves to be lost and ruined and that heaven and earth, God and all His angels, are opposed to us. This is what the prophet is speaking about in the words quoted above from the psalm. It is hard to stand fast in such a situation.</p><p>From all this, you also see why so few actually confess their faith in a thoroughly consistent manner. One man is afraid of his wife; another man is afraid of his children. There is also concern for property. There are also those, and they are perhaps a majority, who are afraid of themselves.</p><p>SL 11:994 (5)</p><p>PRAYER: Remove from us all fear of men and other earthly considerations, heavenly Father, and let our confession at all times ring out loud and clear, in Jesus’ name. Amen.</p><p> </p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

But the devil has a very sharp tongue and can push something right into our heart, making it tremble, and filling us with such fear that we imagine ourselves to be lost and ruined and that heaven and earth, God and all His angels, are opposed to us. This is what the prophet is speaking about in the words quoted above from the psalm. It is hard to stand fast in such a situation.</p><p>From all this, you also see why so few actually confess their faith in a thoroughly consistent manner. One man is afraid of his wife; another man is afraid of his children. There is also concern for property. There are also those, and they are perhaps a majority, who are afraid of themselves.</p><p>SL 11:994 (5)</p><p>PRAYER: Remove from us all fear of men and other earthly considerations, heavenly Father, and let our confession at all times ring out loud and clear, in Jesus’ name. Amen.</p><p> </p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>THE FIRST WEEK AFTER ASCENSION - MONDAY</p><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW+16%3A24-28%C2%A0&version=ESV">MATTHEW 16:24-28</a></p><p>“They will put you out of the synagogues; indeed, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God.” John 16:2</p><p>The cross is pictured here in its true colors. To lie at home sick in bed is nothing compared to this, even though it is often regarded as suffering a cross. Christ is referring here to a very special cross, that of being persecuted, with the possibility of being put to death in disgrace. Not only so, but our persecutors receive praise and win renown. They seem to have right on their side and are honored. On our side, there is nothing but disgrace, shame, and injustice.</p><p>The persecuting world actually believes that it is advancing God’s honor. The world is also of the opinion that we are receiving our just deserts and that God, the Scriptures, and all the angels are against us. In the view of the world, we really have no grounds for complaint. We cannot lay claims to justice, but we are accursed and must be removed from the scene with shame and disgrace.</p><p>This is precisely what happened to Christ. He was subjected to a most scornful and disgraceful death, hung between two robbers or murderers, and regarded as an arch-criminal. Blasphemous words were hurled at Him. “He called Himself God’s Son; let Him help Himself now if He wants things otherwise!” And so, Jesus says here to His disciples that they will suffer death—not just simple death, but a disgraceful death—and the world will imagine that it is advancing God’s honor thereby.</p><p>In the face of such hard and harsh reality, one must still hold fast to faith and confess that God is gracious to us and is our Savior against the whole world, with all its glitter and empty show. We must confess our faith, no matter how hard and harsh the opposition may be, if we are really concerned about our true welfare.</p><p>SL 11:993 (4)</p><p>PRAYER: Grant us the needed grace, faith, and power, dear Savior, to bear whatever cross may come upon us and to confess our faith boldly before the whole world, for Your name’s sake.

      <title>Ascension - Saturday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>ASCENSION - SATURDAY</p><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+47%C2%A0&version=ESV">PSALM 47</a></p><p>Thou didst ascend the high mount, leading captives in thy train, and receiving gifts among men, even among the rebellious, that the Lord God may dwell there. Psalm 68:18</p><p>All the prophets were very careful to describe the ascension of Christ and His kingdom. As His dying and death are deeply embedded in Scripture, so also is His kingdom, resurrection, and ascension into heaven. One must understand Christ’s ascension into heaven correctly; otherwise, it is powerless and sapless.</p><p>Of what use is it to preach only that He has ascended and now sits up there in idleness? The prophet wants to tell us more here in the psalm. Christ ascended into heaven, he declares, leading captivity in His train. This means that He is not only sitting up there on high but that He is also down here on earth. He ascended on high to be present here on earth, so that He might be able to fill all things and be present in all places. This He could not do during His earthly sojourn, for all eyes could not then see Him.</p><p>He sat down where everyone can see Him and where He can deal with everyone, fill every creature, be present everywhere. All things are not filled by Him, and there is nothing so great in heaven and earth that He does not exercise authority over it. Everything must do what He wills and no more. He not only rules and governs all creatures (for thereby my faith would not necessarily be helped or my sins taken away) but He has also led captivity captive.</p><p>SL 11:942 (30)</p><p>PRAYER: Help us to realize the wonderful blessings and assurances which are ours, Lord Jesus, as a direct result of Your ascension into heaven. You are indeed Lord of lords and King of kings, present with us everywhere. In us sinners, however, dear Lord, let Your ascension be a guarantee that You are sin’s conqueror, having led captivity captive. Grant us the full realization of all this, in Your name. Amen.</p><p> </p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <title>Ascension of Our Lord - Thursday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>THE ASCENSION OF OUR LORD - THURSDAY</p><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MARK+16%3A14-20&version=ESV">MARK 16:14-20</a></p><p>Then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God. Mark 16:19</p><p>We must regard the ascension of Christ as an efficacious, powerful act which is in continuous and ceaseless operation. We must not just imagine that Christ has ascended into heaven and left us here on earth to be ruled in other ways. On the contrary, He has ascended into heaven because He can achieve most and rule most effectively by that act.</p><p>If He had remained visibly here on earth among men, He could never have achieved as much. Not all people would then have been able to be with Him to hear Him. He had to make a start on having to deal with all men, ruling all men, preaching to all men, so that all might hear Him and that He might be with all men.</p><p>Take care, therefore, that you do not form the idea that Christ is now far away from you. The contrary is true. When He was on earth, He was far away from us; since His ascension, He is very close to us.</p><p>Reason, of course, cannot understand this, so the ascension is an article of faith. Here one must close the eyes to reason and grasp matters by faith. God’s Word tells us that the man Christ Jesus ascended visibly into heaven where He now sits at God’s right hand and governs all things.</p><p>SL 11:940 (24-25)</p><p>PRAYER: Christ our Savior ascended visibly into heaven from where He now rules and governs all things. Make us aware of the full import of this mighty act of our Savior, heavenly Father, so that we look more confidently to Jesus as Lord of lords and King of kings. Amen.</p><p> </p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication. For an alternate English translation of this sermon, see Lenker, Church Postil—Gospels, 3:180-194.</p>

Words of promise from God always call for faith on our part. Faith is a firm, undoubted confidence in the truth of God’s promise. He who prays to God with doubts in his heart is tempting God. He has his doubts about God’s will and grace. His prayer must be meaningless.

And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have obtained the requests made of him” (1 John 5:14-15). In these words, St. John describes how a truly believing heart prays. It is quite sure and certain that prayer is heard and that it will be answered.</p><p>The Holy Spirit must give this faith and absolute certainty. Without the Holy Spirit, there can be no real Christian prayer. Try it out now and pray in this way! Then you will also experience the wonderful sweetness of this promise of God. You will also gain courage and the comfort of heart to make a variety of prayers, no matter how great or high the petitions may be.<br />SL 11:920 (5-6)</p><p>AE 77:253-54</p><p>PRAYER: Heavenly Father, Your promises to us are sure and certain. Therefore, we take You at Your Word and bring all our requests and needs before You in prayer in the confidence that You will hear and answer them, in the name of Jesus. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>EASTER - WEEK 4 - TUESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=HEBREWS+10%3A26-31&version=ESV">HEBREWS 10:26-31</a></p><p>Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world; he who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” John 8:12</p><p>Christ has come and proclaimed the truth that everything we do apart from the Holy Spirit, no matter how great it is and how lovely it appears to be, is sin. We cannot do anything good gladly and willingly without the Holy Spirit. Christ came on earth to take our place. He has taken away all our sins. As a result of this, we have received the Holy Spirit through whom we have also obtained love and the desire to do what God wants us to do.</p><p>This entire work of Christ is God’s free gift to us, so that we should never presume to come before God with our own works, but solely and only through Christ and His merits. Through the work of Christ, it also comes to pass that sin for us is no longer what we have done contrary to God’s Law.

We cannot do anything good gladly and willingly without the Holy Spirit. Christ came on earth to take our place. He has taken away all our sins. As a result of this, we have received the Holy Spirit through whom we have also obtained love and the desire to do what God wants us to do.</p><p>This entire work of Christ is God’s free gift to us, so that we should never presume to come before God with our own works, but solely and only through Christ and His merits. Through the work of Christ, it also comes to pass that sin for us is no longer what we have done contrary to God’s Law. The Law played no part at all in making us righteous and acceptable before God, because by nature we cannot do this.</p><p>What then is “sin” in view of the work of Christ? It is nothing else but the rejection of the Savior and the refusal to accept Him who can remove our sins from us. Where Christ is present, there is no sin. He brings with Him the Holy Spirit, who enkindles faith in our hearts and the desire to do what is good.</p><p>The world is no longer convicted or condemned because of any other sin, for Christ has destroyed all sin.

Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

Not only is it ignorant of sin, of righteousness, and of judgement, but it cannot recognize this fact, not to mention the utter impossibility of getting rid of this ignorance.</p><p>Here you see also how all credibility is taken from those who want to train others in the ways of godliness when they do not even know what sin is. It would be both interesting and instructive to examine our theological schools and learned theologians on the means of the one little word “sin.” Have you ever heard it said or taught that “sin” is not believing in Christ? They tell us that “sin” is to speak, desire, or do something contrary to God’s will and commandment.</p><p>How does this agree with Christ’s statement here that the Holy Spirit will convict the world of sin “because they do not believe in me”? It is not so difficult to convict the world of being ignorant of sin, even though it is a very learned world. The world will not find it easy to explain this text.</p><p>SL 11:866 (3)</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, heavenly Father, keep us ever mindful of the seriousness of the sin of rejecting your salvation in Christ. Open our hearts by Your Holy Spirit so that we may cling firmly in true faith to Christ and all His blessings for us, for Your mercy’s sake.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>EASTER - WEEK 3 - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+33%3A13-22&version=ESV">PSALM 33:13-22</a></p><p>“You have sorrow now, but I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.” John 16:22</p><p>These words are spoken to all Christians. A Christian must face temptation, fear, distress, opposition, and sorrow in whatever manner they may arise. Jesus makes no mention here of suffering on a cross; He simply mentions “sorrow,” and that they will have reason to “weep and lament.”</p><p>In the world, Christians always experience persecutions of many kinds. Some suffer the loss of goods; others come under disgrace and contempt as the result of evil rumors. Some are drowned; others burnt. Some even lose their head. One meets his end in this way; another in that way. It is the invariable experience of the Christian to suffer misfortune and persecution. Only rarely is he quite free from distress and opposition. He is always being belabored and flogged in some way or other, and he can look for nothing better as long as he is here on earth. This is the badge by which he is known. He who is a Christian must not be ashamed of this badge.</p><p>Why does God act in this way? Why does He allow His children to be persecuted and hounded in this manner? He does it to subdue and suppress man’s free will so that man does not seek help and assistance from his own efforts, but, as far as free will is concerned, he becomes a fool in regard to the works of God and learns to trust and rely on God alone and not on himself.</p><p>SL 11:835 (16-17)</p><p>PRAYER: It is Your will, heavenly Father, that we must experience trials and tribulations as Your children in the midst of a hostile world. Strengthen our faith and endue us with the grace to squarely meet all our commitments, for the love of our Savior. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

Peter declared boldly that he would rather die than deny Christ, and all the other disciples concurred with him (Matthew 26:35).

Christ withdraws Himself from you and allows you to become enmeshed in the power of sin, death, and hell. Your heart will become powerless to devise a way of bringing peace to your conscience, do whatever it may. Christ goes on His way and dies. Then you will hear the little refrain: “A little while, and you will see me no more.”</p><p>Where will you turn? There is no consolation, no help anywhere. You are held fast in the midst of sin, in the midst of death, in the midst of hell. If Christ did not come to you in this situation, without any merit on your part, you would have to remain forever in such fear and terror. This would also have been the situation of the disciples had Christ not risen and become alive again. Therefore, it was necessary for Him to rise again from the dead.</p><p>SL 11:834 (12)  </p><p>PRAYER: In the resurrection of Your Son, our Lord heavenly Father, you have given us sure and certain proof of the validity of His death for the forgiveness of our sins, life, and salvation.

But the second “little while” when He said, “Again, a little while, and you will see me,” they could not comprehend. We cannot comprehend this either.

We should be sure that matters cannot be otherwise than set forth in the Word, however much appearances may be to the contrary.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>EASTER - WEEK 3 - MONDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+30%3A1-5&version=ESV">PSALM 30:1-5</a></p><p>“A little while, and you will see me no more; again, a little while, and you will see me.” John 16:16</p><p>“A little while,” Jesus says, “and you will see me no more.” He is about to be taken captive and put to death on the cross. But this will not be for long. During this “little while” they will certainly be sad. “But cling firmly to Me and follow me,” the Lord means to say to His disciples, “matters will soon take a turn for the better.” He would be in the grave for only three days, during which the world would rejoice as though it had triumphed over Him. And His disciples would mourn and weep.</p><p>“Again, a little while, and you will see me,” says Jesus to His disciples, “because I go to the Father” (cf. John 16:10). He would rise again on the third day, and they would rejoice, and their joy no man would take from them. It would not be a joy just for three days like the joy of the world, but eternal joy. In these words, the evangelist John has set forth an excellent summary of the death and resurrection of Christ: “A little while, and you will see me no more; again, a little while, and you will see me.”</p><p>The “little while” has special significance for us. Grief is but for a moment, a “little while,” as the Lord also reminds His children through Isaiah, “For a brief moment I forsook you, but with great compassion I will gather you. In overflowing wrath for a moment, I hid my face from you, but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you, says the Lord, your Redeemer” (Isaiah 54:7-8).</p><p>SL 11:831 (4-6)</p><p>PRAYER: You have assured us, heavenly Father, that You will never lay a cross on us without supplying us with the strength to bear it and that joy will always follow our sorrows. Fix this firmly in our hearts by faith, so that we boldly endure unto the end, in and through Jesus and His love. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>EASTER - WEEK 3 - SUNDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JOHN+16%3A16-23&version=ESV">JOHN 16:16-23</a></p><p>“Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy.” John 16:20</p><p>You see here how Christ announces to His disciples that they will become sad because He is about to leave them. They are still quite simple and unlearned, considerably disturbed by what Jesus said when He instituted His Holy Supper. They cannot understand what He is talking about. Indeed, the subject of Christ’s discussion here is too profound and incomprehensible for our weak, fallen nature. It was necessary for the disciples to be sorrowful before they experienced joy.</p><p>Christ Himself is an example for us, to show us that we cannot enter glory without a cross. That is also why He said to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus, “Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?” (Luke 24:26).</p><p>If the beloved disciples were about to experience great joy, it was necessary for them to have previously experienced great sadness. This joy, however, came to them from the Lord Jesus, for in the Gospel it is established that outside of Christ there is no joy. On the other hand, where Christ is, there is no sorrow, as we are clearly reminded in the text.</p><p>SL 11:830 (2)</p><p>PRAYER: In You alone, Lord Jesus, there is the true joy of salvation. Implant this in our hearts in full measure as our greatest treasure, for Your love’s sake. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>EASTER - WEEK 3 - SUNDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JOHN+16%3A16-23&version=ESV">JOHN 16:16-23</a></p><p>“Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy.” John 16:20</p><p>You see here how Christ announces to His disciples that they will become sad because He is about to leave them. They are still quite simple and unlearned, considerably disturbed by what Jesus said when He instituted His Holy Supper. They cannot understand what He is talking about. Indeed, the subject of Christ’s discussion here is too profound and incomprehensible for our weak, fallen nature. It was necessary for the disciples to be sorrowful before they experienced joy.</p><p>Christ Himself is an example for us, to show us that we cannot enter glory without a cross. That is also why He said to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus, “Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?” (Luke 24:26).</p><p>If the beloved disciples were about to experience great joy, it was necessary for them to have previously experienced great sadness. This joy, however, came to them from the Lord Jesus, for in the Gospel it is established that outside of Christ there is no joy. On the other hand, where Christ is, there is no sorrow, as we are clearly reminded in the text.</p><p>SL 11:830 (2)</p><p>PRAYER: In You alone, Lord Jesus, there is the true joy of salvation. Implant this in our hearts in full measure as our greatest treasure, for Your love’s sake. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication. For an alternate English translation of this sermon, see Lenker, Church Postil—Gospels, 3:72-86.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>EASTER - WEEK 2 - THURSDAY</p><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROMANS+2%3A19-26%C2%A0&version=ESV">ROMANS 2:19-26</a></p><p>The law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. John 1:17</p><p>You have often heard how God sent a twofold proclamation into the world. The one is to proclaim God’s Word as Law and tell men: “You shall have no other gods before me.…You shall not kill, commit adultery, steal” (Exodus 20:3,13-15). In this proclamation, men also hear the threat that if they do not keep this Law they will die. This proclamation never succeeds in making a man truly righteous in his heart. For although a man is compelled by this proclamation to live a pious life outwardly before his fellow men, in his heart of hearts he is hostile to this Law and would prefer that it did not really exist.</p><p>The other form in which God’s Word is proclaimed is the Gospel. This tells us where a man must look for the ability to do what the Law demands. The Gospel does not drive a man on with threats; it coaxes men in all friendliness. The Gospel does not say, “Do this; do that!” but, “Come, I will instruct you where you can receive and obtain the wherewithal to become truly acceptable to God. See, here is the Lord Jesus Christ. He will give you all this.”</p><p>These two forms of proclamation are in opposition to each other, like taking and giving, demanding and donating, and one must get a good grasp of this distinction. This distinction has always played a very important role in God’s government of the world and still does. The Law must be preached to rough, uncouth men who have no knowledge at all of the Gospel. These men must come under the compulsion of the Law until they are mellowed and acknowledge their weaknesses. When they reach this stage, they are ready for the Gospel.   </p><p>SL 11:778 (2-3)</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, our heavenly Father, continue to show us by Your holy Law that we are poor, lost, and condemned sinners when judged by our works, but above all, continue to let the light of Your wonderful Gospel shine into our hearts with its message of salvation, for Christ’s sake. Amen.</p><p> </p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>EASTER - WEEK 2- TUESDAY</p><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%202:1-6&version=ESV">1 TIMOTHY 2:1-6</a></p><p>A bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not quench. Isaiah 42:3</p><p>Matthew declares that these words of Isaiah were fulfilled in Christ (Matthew 12:20). A bruised reed is a reed very close to breaking point. One who has received a very serious injury or is carrying a very heavy wound—that is, a Christian who is not only weak and stumbling, but who is overwhelmed in temptation, actually breaking a leg, so to say. It may be that he has fallen so deeply that he denies the Gospel, as Peter did when he denied Christ.</p><p>Even if such a man has stumbled, suffering a reverse and a complete upset, you should not reject him as though he never belonged to Christ’s kingdom. You must allow Christ to retain His peculiar characteristic, that in His kingdom there is nothing but grace and mercy, pure and abounding. He is ever ready to help those who realize their wretchedness and misery, and who would be glad to get rid of it.</p><p>Christ’s kingdom is a kingdom where men find true comfort and consolation. He is a consoling, friendly shepherd, coaxing and encouraging every man to draw close to Him. Christ alone is the one true, good shepherd who heals all ills and helps the fallen to rise again. He who does not do that is no shepherd.</p><p>SL 11:785 (16-17)</p><p>PRAYER: It is Your declared will, heavenly Father, that all men should learn to know Your mercy, grace, and salvation. Grant that we, too, may become entrusted to help fallen sinners to find real help and consolation, for Christ, our Savior’s sake. Amen.</p><p> </p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

If you forgive the sins of any they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.” John 20:22-23</p><p>This is a great and powerful authority which no one can adequately praise, bestowed upon poor mortal man and valid over sin, death, hell, and all things.

For when you speak this word, God is in your mouth, and hence, this work is as powerful as a word spoken by God Himself.”</p><p>It follows, therefore, that when Christ speaks a word because He is Lord over sin and death, and say to you, “Your sins are forgiven you,” then your sins must be gone, and nothing can gainsay it. On the other hand, if He declares, “Your sins are not forgiven you,” then they must remain unforgiven, and in this case not even an angel, or a saint, or any creature can forgive you those sins, even if you martyr yourself to death over them.</p><p>It is this power to forgive sins that Christ confers on every individual Christian inasmuch as Christ has made all authority in heaven and on earth available to us (Matthew 28:18).

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>EASTER - WEEK 1 -FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=EPHESIANS+4%3A9-16&version=ESV">EPHESIANS 4:9-16</a></p><p>“As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.” John 20:21</p><p>The most important work of love that any Christian can perform after coming to faith in Christ is to bring others to faith in the way he was brought to faith. In this connection, Christ lays an obligation upon every individual Christian and sets up the office of ministering the external Word. He Himself came to the disciples with this office and the external Word</p><p>Let us grasp this clearly, for we must be told about it, and the Lord wants to tell us here, “You have enough from me: peace and joy, and all that you should have. For your own persons you need no more. Hence, get busy; take a close look at the picture and do as I have done to you! My father sent me into the world for your sakes alone, to help you, not to benefit myself. I have carried out His will, died for you, and given you all that I am and have. Think of this and do likewise. From now on, serve and help everyone else. Otherwise, there is nothing here on earth for you to do. Through faith, you already have enough of everything. And so, I send you out into the world as my Father has sent me. Every single Christian should instruct and teach his neighbor in order to bring him to faith.”</p><p>This authority has not only been given to the pope and his bishops; it has been entrusted to all Christians. They should openly confess their faith to bring others to that faith as well.</p><p>SL 11:730 (13)</p><p>PRAYER: Heavenly Father, give us at all times a joyous faith and a ready tongue to confess You before men and to lead them to the joy of the salvation which is ours in and through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>EASTER - WEEK 1 -FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=EPHESIANS+4%3A9-16&version=ESV">EPHESIANS 4:9-16</a></p><p>“As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.” John 20:21</p><p>The most important work of love that any Christian can perform after coming to faith in Christ is to bring others to faith in the way he was brought to faith. In this connection, Christ lays an obligation upon every individual Christian and sets up the office of ministering the external Word. He Himself came to the disciples with this office and the external Word</p><p>Let us grasp this clearly, for we must be told about it, and the Lord wants to tell us here, “You have enough from me: peace and joy, and all that you should have. For your own persons you need no more. Hence, get busy; take a close look at the picture and do as I have done to you! My father sent me into the world for your sakes alone, to help you, not to benefit myself. I have carried out His will, died for you, and given you all that I am and have. Think of this and do likewise. From now on, serve and help everyone else. Otherwise, there is nothing here on earth for you to do. Through faith, you already have enough of everything. And so, I send you out into the world as my Father has sent me. Every single Christian should instruct and teach his neighbor in order to bring him to faith.”</p><p>This authority has not only been given to the pope and his bishops; it has been entrusted to all Christians. They should openly confess their faith to bring others to that faith as well.</p><p>SL 11:730 (13)</p><p>PRAYER: Heavenly Father, give us at all times a joyous faith and a ready tongue to confess You before men and to lead them to the joy of the salvation which is ours in and through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>EASTER - WEEK 1 - SUNDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JOHN+20%3A19-31&version=ESV">JOHN 20:19-31</a></p><p>On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.” John 20:19</p><p>As Christians, we must apply the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ to ourselves individually. It is not enough simply to believe that He rose from the dead, for such a faith in itself will not mean peace and joy for us, nor power and might. You must also believe that He rose for your sake and for your benefit. He was not raised into glory for His own sake alone but that He might help you and all who believe in Him and that through His resurrection He might overcome sin, death, and hell.</p><p>This is also indicated by the way in which Christ enters through the locked doors and steps forth and stands in the midst of His disciples. The manner in which He stood here in the midst of the disciples resembles that manner in which He also stands in our hearts. In this way, He is also in our midst, just as He was standing there among the disciples.</p><p>When He stands in our hearts in this manner, we hear His loving voice speaking to our conscience, “Be at your ease: there is no need at all for any anxiety. Your sins are forgiven you and removed from you and nothing can henceforth harm you.”</p><p>SL 11:725 (2-3)</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, heavenly Father, in Your great love for us, You gave Your Son to suffer and die for our sins. By His glorious resurrection from the dead, You have demonstrated that the sacrifice of Your Son has been accepted and that now all is well with us in time and eternity, in and through our Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication. For an alternate English translation of this sermon, see Lenker, Church Postil—Gospels, 2:352-63.</p>

In this way, your heart will be warmed towards Him, and your confidence and faith will be strengthened.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF EASTER - FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW+26%3A69-75+&version=ESV">MATTHEW 26:69-75</a></p><p>Jesus our Lord … was put to death for our trespasses and raised for our justification. Romans 4:25</p><p>You cast your sins from yourself on to Christ when you firmly believe that His wounds and sufferings are your sins, that He bore them and paid for them as Isaiah declared: “The Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all” (Isaiah 53:6). Peter also says: “He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree,” that is, the cross (1 Peter 2:24), and St. Paul wrote to the Corinthians: “He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him” (2 Corinthians 5:21, AV).</p><p>On this and similar passages you must stake everything in full reliance, and the more so if your conscience is giving you serious trouble.

It does not matter how much penitence and satisfaction we have to offer; our sins keep on piling up and gaining the upper hand. But when we see them borne by Christ and conquered by His glorious resurrection from the dead and we have boldness of faith, our sins are dead and blotted out. For they could not remain on Christ. They have been swallowed up by His resurrection. Now you see no wounds, no pains in Him, that is, no signs of sin.</p><p>SL 11:580 (13)<br />AE 76:430</p><p>PRAYER: Thanks and praise be to You, Lord Jesus, for the complete victory over sin which You gained for us when You bore our sins on the cross and destroyed them in Your glorious resurrection from the dead.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>THE WEEK OF EASTER - WEDNESDAY</p><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2055%3A6-9&version=ESV">ISAIAH 55:6-9</a></p><p>Now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully, even as I have been fully understood. 1 Corinthians 13:12</p><p>We should always be very careful not only to hear the truth that we are Christ’s brethren with our bodily ears. We should feel and experience this truth in our very hearts. Then we shall never become over-weening and conceited, but this fact will fill our hearts with wonder.</p><p>True, pious, and godly Christians are always deeply conscious of their very serious limitations. In humility and modesty, they will begin to wonder how such miserable sinners as they are, drowned in sins, could ever become worthy enough to have God’s Son as their brother. How does it come to pass that such a wretched creature as I am enjoys such a privilege?</p><p>At the same time, such a Christian is amazed at this fact and meditates upon it. It certainly requires great effort to believe it. Indeed, if one actually experienced this fact for what it really is and involves, one would perforce have to die in that very instant. For man who is flesh and blood cannot comprehend this fact.</p><p>As long as we live in this life, our heart is far too restricted to be able to grasp such a fact. After death, when our heart is enlarged, we shall be able to comprehend fully what we have heard through the Word.</p><p>SL 11:606 (8)</p><p> </p><p>PRAYER: Your ways are not our ways, and Your thoughts are not our thoughts, heavenly Father.

It certainly requires great effort to believe it. Indeed, if one actually experienced this fact for what it really is and involves, one would perforce have to die in that very instant. For man who is flesh and blood cannot comprehend this fact.</p><p>As long as we live in this life, our heart is far too restricted to be able to grasp such a fact. After death, when our heart is enlarged, we shall be able to comprehend fully what we have heard through the Word.</p><p>SL 11:606 (8)</p><p> </p><p>PRAYER: Your ways are not our ways, and Your thoughts are not our thoughts, heavenly Father. Enlighten us by Your Holy Spirit in such a way that we believe Your Word, even where we may not fully understand it, for Christ our Savior’s sake. Amen.</p><p> </p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <title>Holy Week - Good Friday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h3>HOLY WEEK - GOOD FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+CORINTHIANS+5%3A14%2C+15&version=ESV">2 CORINTHIANS 5:14, 15</a></p><p>Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God. 1 Peter 3:18</p><p>Thorns pricked the sacred head of Christ, but you have actually deserved the pricks of more than a hundred thousand thorns. To be sure, you have deserved to be pricked by such thorns in all eternity, and much worse than He was pricked. Christ had to suffer the agony of having His hands and feet pierced with nails; you have deserved to suffer from much worse nails in eternity.</p><p>This is what will indeed befall those who disregard Christ’ suffering on their behalf. In this grim reflection, Christ does not lie or scold; what He indicates must surely follow. St. Bernard says, “I thought I was secure and knew nothing of the eternal sentence passed upon me in heaven until I saw that the only-begotten Son of God had mercy on me, stepped forth, and submitted to the sentence of condemnation on my behalf.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>HOLY WEEK - GOOD FRIDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+CORINTHIANS+5%3A14%2C+15&version=ESV">2 CORINTHIANS 5:14, 15</a></p><p>Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God. 1 Peter 3:18</p><p>Thorns pricked the sacred head of Christ, but you have actually deserved the pricks of more than a hundred thousand thorns. To be sure, you have deserved to be pricked by such thorns in all eternity, and much worse than He was pricked. Christ had to suffer the agony of having His hands and feet pierced with nails; you have deserved to suffer from much worse nails in eternity.</p><p>This is what will indeed befall those who disregard Christ’ suffering on their behalf. In this grim reflection, Christ does not lie or scold; what He indicates must surely follow. St. Bernard says, “I thought I was secure and knew nothing of the eternal sentence passed upon me in heaven until I saw that the only-begotten Son of God had mercy on me, stepped forth, and submitted to the sentence of condemnation on my behalf. If there is such seriousness here, it is not for me to play around any longer and to be secure.”</p><p>This also explains Christ’s words to the women of Jerusalem: “Do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.… If they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?” (Luke 23:28, 31). Jesus means to say: “From my sufferings, learn what you have deserved and what will befall you.”</p><p>Christ’s sufferings should always be pondered with the greatest of seriousness on our part. They are written for our warning to teach us the awful and horrible nature of sin.</p><p>SL 11:577 (6-7)<br />AE 76:427</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, our heavenly Father, let the awful sufferings and death of our Lord Jesus Christ be for us a continual reminder of the horrible nature of all sin in your sight. Move us at all times to a serious consideration of our Savior’s passion and death on our behalf. Amen.</p>

Galatians 6:2</p><p>Not the least part of love or self-surrender is for me to be able to give away my self-conceit or arrogance. I can no doubt give my neighbor temporal good and bodily service with my painstaking toil. I can also serve him with instruction and intercession, for example, by visiting him and consoling him when he is sick or sad. I can feed him when he is hungry, free him from imprisonment, and such like. But the greatest of all the services I can render my neighbor is bearing his weakness.</p><p>We will always fall short of the mark here. We will never attain to the perfection of Christ in this regard. He is the pure, bright Sun in which there is no mist. Our light is just like a glimmering stalk of straw in comparison with this Sun. Christ is a glowing oven full of fire and perfect love. But He is still satisfied with our little candle, if we provide some sort of evidence of letting our love shine forth.</p><p>Take a look at the Gospel record and see how Christ dealt with His disciples. He bore with them when they were guilty of foolish conduct and even when they, at times, went astray. In their service, His wisdom yielded to their folly. He did not condemn them but bore their weakness with long-suffering patience. “What I am doing you do not know now, but afterward you will understand,” He tells them on one occasion (John 13:7). Through such love He gives up His righteousness, judgement, might, wrath, punishment, and the rights he has over us and our sins. He could condemn us because of our folly. But He does no more than to say, “You are in the wrong; you do not know anything; do not, however, reject me, but trust me.”</p><p>And so I say that it is no small example of love to be able to bear with our neighbor when he is weak in faith and love.</p><p>SL 11:597 (26)<br />AE 76:445-46</p><p>PRAYER: Dear Lord Jesus, fill our hearts at all times with such love for our neighbor that we understand his weaknesses and needs and continue to bear with him, for Your name’s sake.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>HOLY WEEK - TUESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=HEBREWS+10%3A1-7&version=ESV">HEBREWS 10:1-7</a></p><p>[Christ said,] “‘Lo, I have come to do thy will, O God,’ as it is written of me in the roll of the scroll.” Hebrews 10:7</p><p>Christ’s sufferings are understood correctly when we do not simply regard the sufferings as such but recognize and grasp His heart and will to suffer. For if one regards His sufferings in isolation without recognizing His heart and will therein, one will be shocked by Christ’s sufferings rather than rejoice in them. But if one sees that Christ’s heart and will are in these sufferings, it produces real comfort, confidence, and pleasure in Christ.</p><p>The psalmist praises this will of God and Christ in suffering when he says, “In the roll of the scroll it is written of me; I delight to do thy will, O my God; thy law is within my heart” (Psalm 40:7-8). The epistle to the Hebrews also refers to this when it says, “By that will we have been sanctified” (Hebrews 10:10). It does not say through the suffering and blood of Christ, which is pure enough, but through the will of God and of Christ, that they were both of one will to sanctify us through Christ’s blood.</p><p>This will to suffer He also manifests in the Gospel (Matthew 16:21-23), where He proclaims beforehand that He is going up to Jerusalem to suffer Himself to be crucified. It is as though He were saying, “Look into my heart to see that I am doing this willingly, without compulsion, and gladly, so that you may not be shocked or dismayed thereby when you see it come to pass and begin to think that I am doing it unwillingly, that I must do it, that I am forsaken, and that the Jews are doing it by their authority.”</p><p>SL 11:526 (3)<br />AE 76:350-51</p><p>PRAYER: Thanks be to You, loving Father, for sending us such a ready and willing Savior, whose love for us has been manifested in His readiness and willingness to suffer and die for us and in our stead. Mercy and love are all Your ways, and those of Your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

He does not mean “keeping” in the sense that “keep” has when one speaks about “keeping” the Law. One “keeps” the Law by means of works. When Christ speaks here of “keeping” His Word, He means “keeping” it in one’s heart by faith, not keeping it with the fist or with works.</p><p>This is the wrong idea that the Jews have when they rage in such a horrible fashion against Christ and say to Him, “Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, as did the prophets; and you say, ‘If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death’” (John 8:52). They do not know what “keep,” “dying,” and “living” mean in this context.</p><p>It is not without good reason that Jesus employs the word “keep” here, because keeping His Word involves a struggle and a battle, for sin bites, death exerts its presence, and hell threatens. Under such conditions we must “keep” Christ’s Word, cling to it firmly, and not let ourselves be parted from it.</p><p>Note how Christ replies to the Jews in praise of His doctrine. “You claim,” He says, “that my Word is from the devil and you want to suppress it even beneath hell. But I say that it has divine power within it and exalt it above all the heavens and all creatures.”</p><p>SL 11:570 (9)<br />AE 76:412</p><p>PRAYER: Lord Jesus, You have clearly shown us in our Gospel that Your teaching is the most precious thing we can ever learn in our earthly lives. Grant us Your grace to appreciate this fact at all times so that we keep Your Word, for Your truth’s sake. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>LENT - WEEK 5 - TUESDAY</h3><p>LESSON:<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROMANS+12%3A14-21&version=ESV"> ROMANS 12:14-21</a></p><p>“I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it, and he will be the judge.” John 8:50</p><p>Why does Jesus not say in John 8:49, “I honor my Father and you dishonor Him”? He says, “You dishonor me.”</p><p>In a veiled manner, He indicates that His Father’s honor and His own honor are identical, one and the same thing, just as He is one God together with His Father. At the same time, however, He wants to remind us that if our ministry in praise of God is to obtain its due honor, it must also suffer shame.</p><p>We should also keep this in mind in our dealings with rulers and priests. When they question our lives, we will put up with it and repay them with love for hate and good for evil; but when they attack our doctrine, they are attacking God’s honor.</p><p>Here there must be a limit to love and patience. We must not remain silent but say, “I honor my Father, and so you dishonor me. It does not matter much that you dishonor me, for I am not seeking my own honor. But at the same time take warning! There is one who is seeking my honor and judging it. The Father will demand it from you and not leave you unpunished. He does not only seek His honor, but mine as well, for He has declared, ‘Those who honor me I will honor’ (1 Samuel 2:30).”</p><p>This is our consolation, so we can be quite joyful. Even though all the world casts shame on us and dishonors us, we are certain that God requires our honor and will punish, judge, and avenge. O that we would only believe it and wait upon Him! He is certainly coming!</p><p>SL.XI.569,7<br />AE 76,410-11</p><p>PRAYER: You have assured us, both by much instruction and many examples, O Lord, that You will adequately defend the honor of Your Word and those who proclaim it.

When your children do something, it is from God; but because I do a thing, it must be from the devil.” That is how the world must react to Christ.

The “sons” who cast out devils, whom Christ mentions here, were, I believe, exorcists who functioned among the people. God bestowed many spiritual gifts on His people from of old.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>LENT - WEEK 4 - THURSDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PSALM+36&version=ESV">PSALM 36</a></p><p>Thy steadfast love, O Lord, extends to the heavens, Thy faithfulness to the clouds. Psalm 36:5</p><p>God’s power and might is in the very bread we eat. He is present in this bread and nourishes us through it and under it, but in an invisible manner. We think that it is the bread that does it all! But where no bread is available, He nourishes men without bread by His Word alone. He acts here also as He acts under the bread, invisibly. The bread is His “fellow worker,” as Paul says, “We are fellow workers for God” (1 Corinthians 3:9).</p><p>Through and under our external office of the ministry, He gives His grace inwardly—that grace which He could actually give without our office and does give without it. But while the office is there, one should not despise it or tempt God.</p><p>So also He nourishes us through bread externally, but inwardly He alone gives the growth and digestion which the bread cannot give. In short, all creatures are God’s masks and mummers, whom He wants to work along with Him and help Him to accomplish all sorts of things, which He could certainly accomplish without their co-operation and also does accomplish without them.</p><p>This is what He has ordained so that we should learn to cling to His pure Word alone. If there is bread, do not put all your confidence in it; if there is no bread, there are still no grounds for despair. Use the bread when it is available and do without it when it is not available.</p><p>But at all times we should be certain that we are nourished by the Word of God, whether bread is available or not. With this faith, one conquers greed, bodily indulgence, and temporal concern for our nourishment.</p><p>SL.XI.539,16<br />AE 76,370</p><p>PRAYER: Keep us ever alert, heavenly Father, to the fact that we continually need the blessing of Your Word in all that we do in our daily lives, even in our eating and drinking, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>LENT - WEEK 4 - SUNDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JOHN+6%3A1-15&version=ESV">JOHN 6:1-15</a></p><p>“Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well.” Matthew 6:33</p><p>In the Gospel of the feeding of the five thousand, Christ once again teaches us the need for faith without anxious worry about food and clothing. Then He stirs us up with a miracle in which He actually demonstrates in deed what He says in words in the Sermon on the Mount, “Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well.”</p><p>We see here that the people follow Him to hear God’s Word and to witness signs. They are seeking God’s kingdom. Jesus does not forsake them but provides them richly with food. He shows quite clearly that before those who seek God’s kingdom should suffer want, the grass in the wilderness should rather become corn and one piece of bread should rather become a thousand loaves, so that what He declared to the devil at the time of His temptation would stand fast, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God” (Matthew 4:4).</p><p>So that this principle of God’s Word should be confirmed and stand fast, He proceeds to provide for these people what they should eat. He consults Philip about the matter even before they make any complaints and ask for food.</p><p>From this we also should learn to let Him do the worrying for us, and we should realize that He thinks about us more and sooner than we think about ourselves.</p><p>SL.XI.562,1<br />AE 76,401</p><p>PRAYER: You know all our needs, O Lord, even before we think about them ourselves. You have promised never to leave or forsake us. Be with us then, O Lord, at all times, for the sake of your truth and mercy. Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>LENT - WEEK 4 - SUNDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=JOHN+6%3A1-15&version=ESV">JOHN 6:1-15</a></p><p>“Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well.” Matthew 6:33</p><p>In the Gospel of the feeding of the five thousand, Christ once again teaches us the need for faith without anxious worry about food and clothing. Then He stirs us up with a miracle in which He actually demonstrates in deed what He says in words in the Sermon on the Mount, “Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well.”</p><p>We see here that the people follow Him to hear God’s Word and to witness signs. They are seeking God’s kingdom. Jesus does not forsake them but provides them richly with food. He shows quite clearly that before those who seek God’s kingdom should suffer want, the grass in the wilderness should rather become corn and one piece of bread should rather become a thousand loaves, so that what He declared to the devil at the time of His temptation would stand fast, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God” (Matthew 4:4).</p><p>So that this principle of God’s Word should be confirmed and stand fast, He proceeds to provide for these people what they should eat. He consults Philip about the matter even before they make any complaints and ask for food.</p><p>From this we also should learn to let Him do the worrying for us, and we should realize that He thinks about us more and sooner than we think about ourselves.</p><p>SL.XI.562,1<br />AE 76,401</p><p>PRAYER: You know all our needs, O Lord, even before we think about them ourselves. You have promised never to leave or forsake us. Be with us then, O Lord, at all times, for the sake of your truth and mercy. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>LENT - WEEK 3 - SATURDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=LUKE+9%3A46-50&version=ESV">LUKE 9:46-50</a></p><p>“He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.” Luke 11:23</p><p>The Gospels are replete with many fine sayings which set forth very important teachings. This is also the case in Christ’s words at the end of the Gospel concerning the healing of the dumb demoniac: “He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.” “The devil is not with me, for I drive him out. And so, he must certainly be against me.”</p><p>However, this saying refers not only to the devil, but to the blasphemers on whom also He passes sentence and condemnation here. They are against Him because they are not with Him.</p><p>To be with Christ means to think with Christ, that is, to believe in Christ, to believe that His works and not our works help us. That is Christ’s position, and that is what He teaches. To “gather” with Christ is to do good in love and to be rich in good works.</p><p>He who does not believe in Christ is compelled to rely on his own works. Such a man is not with Christ but against Christ. He denies Christ because he builds on his own works. A man who does not love does not gather with Christ but performs vain works, whereby he becomes worse and gets further away from faith.</p><p>SL.XI.556,11<br />AE 76,396</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, our loving, heavenly Father, grant us at all times such an understanding and clarity of faith that we are always absolutely with Christ and not against Him, gathering with Him and not scattering. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>LENT - WEEK 3 - TUESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=TITUS+3%3A8-11&version=ESV">TITUS 3:8-11</a></p><p>Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!” And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. Mark 1:25,26</p><p>No one should imagine that the evil spirits at times present an appearance of disunity and that one yields to the other to deceive men. For it is quite evident that they offer resistance, demur, cry out and storm, tear and rage when they sense that an earnest effort is being made to drive them out. They are opposed to Christ and at variance with Him, yielding to Him under compulsion and unwillingly.

Mark 1:25,26</p><p>No one should imagine that the evil spirits at times present an appearance of disunity and that one yields to the other to deceive men. For it is quite evident that they offer resistance, demur, cry out and storm, tear and rage when they sense that an earnest effort is being made to drive them out. They are opposed to Christ and at variance with Him, yielding to Him under compulsion and unwillingly.

Luke 11:14</p><p>This is a beautiful Gospel in which we learn a great deal about many different things, and in it there is portrayed almost all that Christ, His kingdom, and Gospel are. We learn what the Gospel achieves and how it makes its way in the world.</p><p>First of all, as do all the Gospels, it teaches us faith and love, for it holds up Christ before us as a savior and help in all needs, out of His great love. He who believes this is saved.</p><p>Here we see also that He has nothing to do with those who are well but with the poor man who is ailing under many troubles. He was blind, as Matthew tells us (12:22), and dumb and possessed by a demon, as Luke says. Most of the deaf are also dumb, so that in Greek the same word is used for deaf and dumb.</p><p>The concern of Jesus for this poor man is an incentive for us to turn to Him in every need, expecting from Him all that is good. After experiencing good at His hands, we should follow Him in love and do good to others, as He has done good to us. This is the common and most delightful teaching of this Gospel and of all the Gospels throughout the whole church year.</p><p>This poor dumb man, moreover, did not come to Jesus without the Word. Those who brought him to Jesus must have heard of Christ’s love, and this moved them to put their trust in Him. Let us always remember that faith comes through the Word.</p><p>SL.XI.552,1</p><p>AE 76,392</p><p> </p><p>PRAYER: Lord Jesus, your love and compassion for men in their trials and troubles was truly wonderful. Be to us a helper and savior also today, for your mercy’s sake. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF SEXAGESIMA - WEDNESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MARK+10%3A17-27&version=ESV">MARK 10:17-27</a></p><p>As for what fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature. Luke 8:14</p><p>The third group are those who hear the Word and understand it, but still fall out on the other side, namely, among the pleasures and comforts of this life so that they, too, achieve nothing with the Word. This is also a very large number.</p><p>Although they do not introduce heresy like the first group, but always retain the Word unalloyed and pure and are not assailed on the left like the second group with opposition and persecution, they still fall away on the right.

For where this Word does not remain, there is no salvation; not even great works and holy lives will help them here. When Jesus says that they will not be saved because the Word has been taken from them, He clearly demonstrates that not works, but faith, saves through the Word alone, as Paul also declares (Romans 1:16).</p><p>SL.XI.517,4<br />AE 76,332</p><p>PRAYER: Grant us true steadfastness and firmness of faith, O Lord, that we both know what we believe and continue therein, walking as closely as possible to the Gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, in whose name we also ask this.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF SEPTUAGESIMA - SUNDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=MATTHEW+20%3A1-16&version=ESV">MATTHEW 20:1-16</a></p><p>Now when the first came, they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius. Matthew 20:10</p><p>The Gospel comes with a levelling action and makes all men equal in sin, so that those who perform many works count for no more than the open sinners and must also become sinners and hear themselves describe in Paul’s words, “All have sinned” (Romans 3:23). No one can be justified before God by what he himself does, by his works.</p><p>At this stage, men look around and begin to despise those who have done practically nothing. They ask themselves why all their pain and labor should count for no more than the laziness and loose living of others.</p><p>They also begin to complain to the householder because they do not think it is fair.

Matthew 20:10</p><p>The Gospel comes with a levelling action and makes all men equal in sin, so that those who perform many works count for no more than the open sinners and must also become sinners and hear themselves describe in Paul’s words, “All have sinned” (Romans 3:23). No one can be justified before God by what he himself does, by his works.</p><p>At this stage, men look around and begin to despise those who have done practically nothing. They ask themselves why all their pain and labor should count for no more than the laziness and loose living of others.</p><p>They also begin to complain to the householder because they do not think it is fair. They actually blaspheme against the Gospel and become quite hardened in their work-righteousness. They love the favor and grace of God and have to content themselves with their temporal reward. They must trudge off with their denarius into condemnation because they served merely for their hire—they were not concerned about any eternal blessing.

Christ declares: “Where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them” (Matthew 18:20). He has also given us the assurance: “If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained” (John 20:23).

James writes of this confession to our neighbor when he says, “Confess our sins one to another.” In this confession, you acknowledge the wrongs you have done to your neighbor. Christ has outlined the procedure which we are to follow in His Sermon on the Mount: “If you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to our brother, and then come and offer your gift.

God will not bestow His grace on anyone and forgive him his sins if he is not prepared to forgive his neighbor. Our faith is not right if it does not produce this fruit, namely, forgiving the neighbor and requesting his forgiveness. Otherwise, we must not come before God. If this is not a fruit of your faith, your faith, as well as your confession to God, is not in order.</p><p>SL.XI.585,6<br />AE 76,435</p><p>PRAYER: Bestow your grace upon us in such measure, O God, that we are duly humbled and readily confess our sins to our neighbor, forgiving him his sins against us, in and through our Savior Jesus Christ.

      <description><![CDATA[THE WEEK OF EPIPHANY V - SUNDAY

LESSON: MATTHEW 13:24-30

The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field; but while men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. Matthew 13:24,25

This Gospel teaches us how the kingdom of God, or Christianity, fares in this world, especially with respect to its doctrine. It must never be our hope and expectation that there will be nothing but orthodox Christians and the pure doctrine of God’s Word on this earth.

There must also be false Christians and heretics so that the genuine Christians may be proved, as Paul reminds us when he says to the Corinthians, “There must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized” (1 Corinthians 11:19).

This parable does not speak of the false Christians who are failures as Christians only outwardly in their lives. He is speaking of those who are false to Christianity in their doctrine and faith, who go under the name of Christians, who make a fine show in playing the hypocrite and are really injurious. It is a question of conscience, not just of outward action. The servants who can recognize the weeds among the wheat must be enlightened by the Holy Spirit.

The whole point here is that we should not be surprised or dismayed if false doctrine and wrong faith of various kinds make their appearance in our midst. The devil is always present in some way or other among the sons of God (Job 1:6).

SL.XI.506,3
AE 76,303

PRAYER: Sanctify our hearts and lives in such a way, O Lord, that we may not harm your kingdom in any way by hypocrisy, but in all things prove ourselves good seed, for Christ the Savior’s sake. Amen.

      <title>Epiphany IV - Wednesday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h3>EPIPHANY IV - WEDNESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROMANS+5%3A1-5&version=ESV">ROMANS 5:1-5</a></p><p>For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith. 1 John 5:4</p><p>Must we not declare that faith which can withstand such mighty enemies as death and the devil, and carry off the victory, is something surpassingly great and wonderful? It is, indeed, as John says, “the victory that overcomes the world.” 1 John 5:4.</p><p>Not that all this comes to pass in peace and quietness. This involves a battle which cannot be fought without bloody wounds. In this strife the heart also feels sin, death, the flesh, the devil, and the world so strongly, that it cannot help thinking that all is lost, that sin and death have gained the victory and the devil is on top. It feels little of the power of faith.</p><p>This is also the state of affairs in this Gospel of the stilling of the tempest (Matthew 8:23-27), when the waves not only buffet the ship, but actually engulf it. It appears that the ship must go down and sink. All this time Christ is lying asleep. There is no hope of life here: death is on top and has scored a victory. Life is lying vanquished. But this is only how matters stand if one judges solely by appearances. As disciples of Christ, we must not draw conclusions and act simply on appearances, but by faith.</p><p>SL.XI.500,6</p><p>AE 76,284</p><p>PRAYER: Dear Lord Jesus, appearances and experiences in this world so often belie our hopes as your disciples. At such times fill our hearts with courageous faith and hope which never falter but cling even more firmly to you when dark clouds hover above us. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>EPIPHANY MONDAY</h3><p>LESSON: 1 PETER 3:13‒17</p><p> </p><p>“Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” Matthew 5:10</p><p>It is a good thing for us that God so rules and orders matters that the Sacrament should not be without persecution. For He instituted it that it might be a password and distinguishing mark of Christianity whereby we may be recognized. For if we did not have it, we would not know where Christians are to be found, who the Christians are, and where the Gospel is bearing fruit. But when men attend the Sacrament, we can see who those are who have given ear to the Gospel, and we can also observe whether they lead Christian lives.

If we lose our life in this confession, we must suffer this, knowing that God will make a more than adequate recompense to us as far as life is concerned. It is quite in order for us to suffer persecution here. If we found nothing but honor everywhere, we would never find ourselves in a truly confessional situation. So we remain in our normal sphere, incurring shame and disgrace. Sometimes we are even threatened with death for the Lord’s sake, as was the case also in the early Church.</p><p>SL.XI.591,15</p><p>PRAYER: We thank and praise You, Lord God, heavenly Father, for the great honor and distinction You bestow upon us in regarding us as worthy to suffer and even die for Your sake, in and through our Savior Jesus Christ.

      <title>Trinity - Week 26 - Saturday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>LESSON: REVELATION 7:9‒12</p><p>Whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith. 1 John 5:4</p><p>You cannot train the youth in particular for God’s kingdom without proper schools nor uphold the Word of God without preaching it from the pulpit. If one allows schools and the pulpit to decline and disappear, one can only expect a Sodom and Gomorrah to eventuate. One must expect also results like those which fell upon Sodom and Gomorrah when these cities cast off the restraints of God’s Word and no longer listened to pious Lot or tolerated him. </p><p>The prophet Ezekiel faced a similar situation when he prophesied concerning Jerusalem, “As I live, says the Lord God, your sister Sodom and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done. Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, surfeit of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy. They were haughty, and did abominable things before Me; therefore I removed them, when I saw it” (Ezekiel 16:48‒50).</p><p>This is how matters stand on all sides today. Every man—the peasant, the burgher (citizen), the nobleman—gathers together nothing but money; he keeps on scraping in his greed, gluttonizes and imbibes and carries on just as if God were nothing at all. No one takes up the beggar’s staff of the poor Christ, but rather tramples it underfoot. As in the case of Sodom and Gomorrah, all obedience, discipline, and respect will go by the board. No amount of admonition and preaching seems to have any results, and evils seem only to increase so that it does not appear that we can continue like this much longer. </p><p>SL.XI.1898,32‒33</p><p>PRAYER: Give us courage and strength at all times, O God, to carry on bravely in the midst of pressing difficulties and even indifference and opposition. Prove Yourself to be God for us by giving us a faith that really overcomes the world, for Christ the Savior’s sake. Amen. </p>

      <title>Trinity - Week 26 - Friday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>LESSON: MATTHEW 10:32‒33</p><p>We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive good or evil, according to what he has done in the body. 2 Corinthians 5:10</p><p>Those hearts are established and sure which await Christ’s judgment seat joyfully and with a good conscience. For they belong to the group and fellowship of those who believe in Christ, and demonstrate the fruits of their faith in the love and goodness they bestow on the poor, or in the patience with which they suffer with them. He who does not have this faith will not practice these works of mercy on his fellow Christians. But he who does these works, and does them because he believes that he has a faithful Savior and Redeemer in Christ who has reconciled him to God, must also have a good and friendly heart towards his neighbor and even towards his enemies, helping them whenever he sees them in need. To be sure, he also has his own sufferings in the opposition his faith encounters from the devil and the world. </p><p>He who is thus minded, I say, should be joyful and in good spirits. He may well already apply to himself the blessed and joyful judgment, “Come, O blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world” (Matthew 25:34). He may well regard himself as “one of the least” of Christ’s brethren, one who has himself suffered hunger and thirst or has served the hungry and the thirsty and shown them mercy, as Christ has shown him mercy.</p><p>SL.XI.1894,24</p><p>PRAYER: Of Your mercy and grace, Lord Jesus, give us at all times a loving heart life Your own heart so that we abound in fruits of faith to our brethren and fellowmen, for Your name’s sake. Amen. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>LESSON: 1 THESSALONIANS 2:11‒13</p><p>You are not lacking in any spiritual gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians 1:7</p><p>Our Lord, come! 1 Corinthians 16:22</p><p>See to it that you are always numbered among those who are good and merciful for Christ’s sake, or suffering for His sake. Then you can await the last day with joy and not be afraid of the judgment. For He has already drawn you out and set you up among those on His right hand. </p><p>We who are Christians should have the earnest desire and hope that the judgment would come, as we also pray in the words, “Thy kingdom come” and “Thy will be done” and “Deliver us from evil” (Matthew 6:10, 13). Hence we shall also rejoice to hear the words, “Come, O blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world” (Matthew 25:34). For this judgment we are waiting. This is one of our chief concerns as Christians. For the sake of this hope, we suffer oppression both from the devil and our own flesh, who try to upset our faith and joy in this regard. Then, too, we have to endure the tyranny and enmity of the world. </p><p>On all sides, we are forced to see and to hear the wanton malice which the devil and the world continually stir up against the Gospel, and so much wretchedness here on earth that we should become thoroughly fed up with this life and cry, “Come, dear Lord, come and redeem us!”</p><p>SL.XI.1893,22‒23</p><p>PRAYER: Lord Jesus, as Your disciples we look forward with joyful anticipation to Your coming to carry out Your work of judgment and to receive us to Yourself. Of Your mercy and grace, keep us ever steadfast in the faith so that Your glorious coming may be for us the consummation of all our hopes and joy, for Your love’s sake. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>LESSON: PSALM 143:7‒12</p><p>“Then the King will say to those at His right hand, ‘Come, O blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.’” Matthew 25:34</p><p>Why does Jesus use the fifth commandment to assess our works of mercy and to point out how men have failed in this respect? </p><p>Those of us who have been called as Christians have obtained mercy through our Lord and have been rescued from God’s wrath and eternal death, receiving in place of all this a gracious God who bestows all that is good upon us in time and eternity. He wants to remind us that we have received all this from God, not only for our salvation, but that we should also regard it as an example to be followed in our own conduct. Because God has shown us mercy that we are not lost in body and soul, we should always act in such a way towards our neighbor that we never come into conflict with the fifth commandment, which basically demands love and mercy. </p><p>We should do this not merely for the sake of the commandment, or any threat of judgment, but because of the example we have received in the exceptionally high and rich goodness that God has manifested to us. This example should not remain without fruit, just as God’s work of redemption is not without power and fruit. </p><p>Although the majority of the hearers may become worse after hearing the Gospel, there must always be some who grasp it correctly and abide by it. For He tells us that He will separate them into two distinct groups. Some of the hearers will prove themselves to have been devout and godly hearers who obey this commandment.</p><p>SL.XI.1893,21</p><p>PRAYER: Bestow such a measure of grace upon us, O Lord, that our faith overflows in love and goodness towards our fellowmen, for Christ’s sake.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>LESSON: MATTHEW 10:40‒42</p><p>“And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.’ Then He will say to those at His left hand, ‘Depart from Me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.’” Matthew 25:40‒41</p><p>If such a terrible and drastic condemnation awaits those who have neglected works of love towards their brethren, what is to become of those who have not only neglected such opportunities, have given Christ nothing, have rendered Him no service at all in His poor ones, but have even robbed them of what they had and forced them into hunger, thirst, and need and, in addition, have even persecuted, hounded, captured, and murdered them? </p><p>Such men are so incontrovertibly wicked and damned into such depths of hell with the devil and his angels that He no longer thinks of them here or speaks of them in particular.

On these He bestows high and glorious praise when He says, “Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me” (Matthew 25:40).</p><p>SL.XI.1891, 17</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, we thank and praise You for the clear warnings of Your Word in which You urge upon us an earnest and consistent profession of our faith. In Your mercy and grace, grant us also such obedience of faith that we may always be certain of receiving our Lord’s approval when He comes to judge the living and the dead. In Jesus’ name. Amen. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>LESSON: LUKE 19:11‒26</p><p>“As you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to Me.” Matthew 25:45</p><p>What do you think that Christ on His judgment seat will say in all brevity to such an unchristian lack of mercy? This is what He will say: “You want to be called a Christian and you make your boast of the Gospel. Did you never hear this sermon which I Myself preached warning you what My judgment and final sentence would be? ‘Depart from Me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry and you gave Me no food, I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome Me, naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me’ (Matthew 25:41‒43). Why have you disregarded all this and acted more disgracefully and more unmercifully against your own brethren than a Turk or a heathen? Are you thinking of making matters right for yourself by offering the excuse, ‘When did I see my brother in any of these situations or conditions?’ Here your own conscience will remind you that there were those of your acquaintance who preached to you, or poor scholars who should have been taught and trained in the Word of God, as well as persecuted, poor, and needy Christians, who should have been given food, drink, and clothing, and also visited.” </p><p>Surely we should hang our heads in shame over against our parents and forefathers, the lords and kings, princes and others, who so richly and benevolently gave gifts even to a point of excess to churches, parishes, schools, institutions, hospitals, and the like, as a result of which neither they nor their descendants became any poorer. What would they have done if they had had the light of the Gospel which we have received?</p><p>SL.XI.1890,14‒15</p><p>PRAYER: Lord our God, in Your Gospel of salvation You have supplied us richly with the most precious gifts and blessings that we can ever enjoy. Strengthen us at all times with Your grace that we may make full use of all these blessings in love towards our brethren and fellowmen, for Jesus’ sake. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XXVI - SUNDAY</p><p>LESSON: MATTHEW 25:31‒42</p><p>“Men will come from east and west, and from north and south, and sit at table in the kingdom of God. And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.” Luke 13:29‒30</p><p>In this Gospel, great prominence is given to good works as proof of the possession or absence of true faith. Those on Christ’s right hand at the judgment, the sheep, have proved the genuineness of their faith in works of love to needy brethren. Those on His left hand, the goats, who have been rejected for eternal punishment in hell, have proved that they really had no saving faith at all by the absence of such works of love to their brethren. Here Christ also indicates that there are many among those regarded as Christians who actually become worse than heathen after hearing the preaching of the Gospel of the forgiveness of sins and of God’s grace through Christ. Christ Himself declared, “Many that are first will be last, and the last first” (Matthew 19:30). </p><p>At the final judgment, it will become quite evident that many of those who should have proved themselves to be true Christians because they heard the Gospel actually became worse and more unmerciful than they were before. One sees clear evidence of this on all sides today. Previously, when good works were enjoined under papal perversions and false acts of worship, everyone was ready and willing to do good works. A single prince or one city was able to provide greater and richer endowments and alms than can be provided today by the joint efforts of all kings and the Emperor. </p><p>Today the whole world has learned nothing else but to lay others under contribution, to practice oppression, open robbery, and stealth by means of lies, deceit, usury, overcharging, and other pressures. Every man tries to gain an advantage over his neighbor, as though he regarded him not as a friend and even much less as a brother in Christ.</p><p>SL.XI.1888,9‒12</p><p>PRAYER: Never let our faith die as a result of greed and selfishness, O God, but let it always be in us a real power unto salvation, productive of many good works, in and through our Savior Jesus Christ.

I warn you not to fall away from pure faith. You do not know at what hour I will come again. When no one is really expecting it, I will suddenly be here again as quickly as a flash of lightning lights up the heavens. Those who have not kept the faith will then be lost.

      <title>Week of Trinity XXV - Thursday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XXV - THURSDAY</p><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+6%3A66-69&version=ESV">JOHN 6:66‒69</a></p><p>Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” John 8:12</p><p>Christ’s words lie before us plain and clear. We must believe them and let them stand. We cannot get over them, even though the holy angels in heaven opposed them. Is not Christ holier than they are, and should not His Word have as much authority as theirs? He does not speak of many, nor of the large body who always make up the majority, but of the smallest group made up from the elect. These are going to stumble to such an extent that there is every likelihood that they could be misled. He warns us not to cling to them when we see them clinging to mere externals. If they never err, then Christ cannot be quite truthful in making this announcement.

We must believe them and let them stand. We cannot get over them, even though the holy angels in heaven opposed them. Is not Christ holier than they are, and should not His Word have as much authority as theirs? He does not speak of many, nor of the large body who always make up the majority, but of the smallest group made up from the elect. These are going to stumble to such an extent that there is every likelihood that they could be misled. He warns us not to cling to them when we see them clinging to mere externals. If they never err, then Christ cannot be quite truthful in making this announcement. Hence, even if all the saints were to come forward and tell me to believe in the pope, I will still not do so, saying, “Even though you are the elect, Christ has said that there will be such terrible and dangerous times that even you will err.” </p><p>We must cling alone to Scripture and God’s Word which declares that He is not here or there.

There have always been those who have tried to gain currency for their ideas of the kingdom of Christ by attaching the Christian Church to external, visible features and circumstances, or even by identifying it with certain prominent leaders, claiming that the kingdom of Christ is wherever a certain leader is to be found. Their chief objective is that we should find them and be influenced by personal relationships and particular styles in our religious persuasions. In other words, everything is decided by external factors.

He is aiming His remarks especially at all the monasteries, religious ranks, and all the special works with which they try to help the souls of men. He warns us to be on our guard and not to allow ourselves to be torn from the foundation on which we stand; namely, that we do not become Christians by any of these institutions, ranks, or works, but are saved from all evil and brought into His kingdom through His blood alone, if we believe in Him. </p><p>He removes from our sight everything temporal and external, and with one word strikes down all doctrine which does not preach faith purely, and all living which is not governed by the correct doctrine of faith. He says here in brief, “If anyone says to you, ‘Lo, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe it.” He means to say, “Be on your guard against everything that leads you to works; for it will deceive you and tear you away from Me.”</p><p>SL.XI.1879,25<br />AE. 79:324-336</p><p>PRAYER: Lord Jesus, protect us at all times against all false doctrine and misunderstandings which would modify our faith and trust in You alone and direct us to our own vain works and merits, for Your mercy and truth’s sake.

These two the evangelists Matthew and Mark toss together without observing any due order as the Gospel of Luke does. All that these evangelists want to do is to give and to relate the words of Christ; they do not trouble themselves with what He spoke first or subsequently.

If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him. For God’s temple is holy, and that temple you are. 1 Corinthians 3:16‒17</p><p>When Christ ascended into heaven, He did not lock up His kingdom in the land of the Jews; He spread it out into the whole world through the Gospel which was preached and heard everywhere. But, like the Jews, we deny and persecute God’s Word and put to death the Christians who confess and preach it. The Romans were the first to do this, but their example has been continued by the pope, the bishops, princes, monks, and priests right up to our day. For five hundred years or more, no one was permitted to preach God’s Word without, at least for appearance sake, reciting the text of the Gospel from the pulpit. But these preachers mostly extracted the doctrine of men from these texts or dragged it into these texts. Whenever anyone raised objections to this, he was silenced with fire and sword.  </p><p>Daniel’s word about the “desolating sacrilege” is certainly important also for us. This “desolating sacrilege” is the false doctrine current in the Church, that men must save themselves by performing all the works imposed on them by the Church and its hierarchy, and by falling in line with all the machinery that has been set up in the Church to force men into obedience to this “desolating sacrilege.” </p><p>The pure doctrine of the Word is the doctrine which we proclaim—that we are saved from sin, death, the devil, and all misfortune through Christ and established in God’s kingdom through the Word and faith.</p><p>Where this is preached and believed, Christ dwells and reigns in the hearts spiritually without means. There the Holy Spirit also dwells with all the blessings and fullness of God’s riches.</p><p>SL.XI.1875,17‒19<br />AE. 79:324-336</p><p>PRAYER: O Lord our God, You have warned us in no uncertain manner that false doctrine can be sacrilege. May we never fall into the sacrilege which sets aside the clear truth of Your Word and substitutes for it the doctrine of men, ending in spiritual sin. In Jesus’ name. Amen.</p>

This “desolating sacrilege” is the false doctrine current in the Church, that men must save themselves by performing all the works imposed on them by the Church and its hierarchy, and by falling in line with all the machinery that has been set up in the Church to force men into obedience to this “desolating sacrilege.” </p><p>The pure doctrine of the Word is the doctrine which we proclaim—that we are saved from sin, death, the devil, and all misfortune through Christ and established in God’s kingdom through the Word and faith.</p><p>Where this is preached and believed, Christ dwells and reigns in the hearts spiritually without means. There the Holy Spirit also dwells with all the blessings and fullness of God’s riches.</p><p>SL.XI.1875,17‒19<br />AE. 79:324-336</p><p>PRAYER: O Lord our God, You have warned us in no uncertain manner that false doctrine can be sacrilege. May we never fall into the sacrilege which sets aside the clear truth of Your Word and substitutes for it the doctrine of men, ending in spiritual sin. In Jesus’ name. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE WEEK OF TRINITY XXIV - SATURDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=TITUS+2%3A11-14&version=ESV">TITUS 2:11‒14</a></p><p>He saved us, not because of deeds done by us in righteousness, but in virtue of His own mercy, . . . through Jesus Christ our Savior. Titus 3:5‒6</p><p>He who wants to have a cheerful conscience which does not fear sin, death, hell, or God’s wrath must not push this Mediator, Christ, out of the way. He is the fountain overflowing with grace who imparts temporal and eternal life. Open your heart and accept Him as your Mediator and you will have all you need. He gushes and flows forth and can do nothing else but give, flow forth, and gush, if only you can believe it. You have the right to the name Christian only when you are a Christian in receiving; otherwise, if you want to give much, you are no Christian. This is the rich, precious Word which Paul praises so highly and can never praise enough, that God intermingles His Son so graciously among us that He pours out His grace over all who accept it.</p><p>From all this it follows that if a Christian does good works and manifests love to his neighbor, he does not become a Christian or acquire a godly status thereby, but he must first be a Christian and have acquired a godly status, and then good works result. He certainly does good works, but his good works do not make him a Christian. The tree brings forth or produces good fruits; the fruits do not make the tree. So here also, no one becomes a Christian by good works, but through Christ alone.</p><p>From all this you should understand what kind of people Christians are and what their kingdom is. As a group, they cling to Christ, and with Him they all have the one spirit and like gifts. On this basis Christians are all equal; the one does not have more in Christ than the other.</p><p>SL.XI.1839,11‒12</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, our heavenly Father, give us a faith that is ever active in works of love to or neighbor, in and through Christ our Savior. Amen.</p><p>Editor’s note: No American Edition (AE) equivalent for today’s sermon excerpt exists at the time of this publication.

      <title>Fourth Week in Advent - Friday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[THE FOURTH WEEK IN ADVENT  - FRIDAY 
LESSON: 2 CORINTHIANS 1:12-22 

Among you stands one whom you do not know. John 1:26 

When John says here, “Among you stands one whom you do not know,” he means to say, “Do not direct your eyes too far into the future! He of whom the prophets have spoken has already been among the Jewish people for thirty years. Take heed and do not let Him go! You do not know Him, and I have come to you to show Him to you.” 

When John says, “Among you stands one,” he is following the manner of Scripture which says, “A prophet will arise” or “appear” (Deuteronomy 13:1). Similarly, we are told in Matthew that false prophets “will arise” or “appear” or “come forth” (Matthew 24:24). God also says to Israel, “The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet from among you, from your brethren.” Deuteronomy 18:15.  

It is John’s office to demonstrate that such establishment, appearance, arising, and awaking has been fulfilled in Christ; He has already come forth in the midst of their brethren as God has promised, and they know it not.  

 It is also part of John’s office as an evangelical preacher to comfort men by showing them how to get rid of their sins. This he does by pointing them to Christ, the coming Savior.  

SL.XI.112, 41 

AE 75,183 

PRAYER: Open our hearts by your Holy Spirit, O Lord, so that we are at all times fully awake to the completed work of our Savior and find our full salvation therein. Amen.

This is what it means truly to make straight the way of the Lord.</p><p>SL.XI.107,27<br />AE 75, 180</p><p>PRAYER: Lord God, heavenly Father, You have assured us that it is Your will that all men should repent and accept Your salvation in Christ. Humble us at all times in true repentance, and thus prepare us for Your salvation in Christ our Savior. Amen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>THE FOURTH WEEK IN ADVENT - WEDNESDAY</h3><p>LESSON: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ISAIAH+40%3A1-11&version=ESV">ISAIAH 40:1-11</a></p><p>They said to him then, “Who are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” He said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord’, as the prophet Isaiah said.” John 1:22, 23</p><p>This is the second part of John’s confession in which he confesses who he is after denying any suggestion of being Christ, Elijah, or a prophet. What he means to say is: “Your salvation is much closer than the presence of any prophet might suggest; do not look so far back into another age that is past. The Lord of all the prophets is here Himself; there is no need of a prophet here. I am this Lord’s forerunner. He is following in my footsteps. I am not prophesying about Him in the capacity of a prophet, but I am crying out as His forerunner, to make room for Him and a way for Him, so that He may enter in.</p><p>I do not say, “Behold, He is about to come,” like the prophets, but I say, “Behold, He is coming and is here. I am not speaking words about Him, but am pointing to Him with my finger, just as Isaiah proclaimed long beforehand that such a cry would arise in the wilderness to prepare the way of the Lord (Isaiah 40:3). That is who I am, and not a prophet. Therefore, stand aside; make room and let the Lord Himself walk among you personally, and look for no more prophecies concerning Him.”</p><p>SL.XI.106, 24<br />AE 75,178</p><p>PRAYER: We thank you, O Lord, for the full and complete testimony of your prophets concerning our Lord Jesus Christ and His salvation, a testimony for us to accept in full confidence and assurance.
