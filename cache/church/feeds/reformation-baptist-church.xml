Sermon Text: 2 Corinthians 11:16-22
As we come to 2 Cor 11:16-22, we see 2 realities regarding our response to frauds and fools among believers:
1. Defending yourself before Fools: When and Why?
(2 Cor 11:16-18)
2. Exposing Fools as Frauds: Who and How?
(2 Cor 11:19-22)
• Danger #1: One Wise in His own Eyes (v. 19)
• Danger #2: One Willingly Exploited by Frauds (v. 20)
• Danger #3: One Full of Himself (v. 21)
• Danger #4: One Priding Himself in Empty Pedigree (v. 22)

Sermon Title: “The Great Hoax of Spiritual Seduction: Part 2”
Sermon Text: 2 Corinthians 11:4-11


As we continue in 2 Corinthians 11:1-11, Paul lays out his most fundamental concern in the church- that you would be distracted from and deceived in your spiritual devotion to Christ!


1. You have been committed to Christ
(2 Corinthians 11:1-2)


2. You are being deceived in your devotion
(2 Corinthians 11:3-4)


3. You desperately need discernment in your judgment
(2 Corinthians 11:5-6)


4. You can trust a ministry of humble, sacrificial service
(2 Corinthians 11:7-11)

                                    <description><![CDATA[

<p>In this expositional sermon, Pastor Brandon Scroggins of Reformation Baptist Church unpacks the Apostle Paul’s teaching in 2 Corinthians 10:12–18, addressing the danger of self-commendation, comparison, and the true measure of a faithful ministry. Drawing from Old and New Testament examples—from Gideon to King Herod, from Corinth to modern culture—this message confronts our temptation to boast in ourselves rather than in the Lord.</p>
<p>We live in an age dominated by social media boasting, insecurity masked by pride, and spiritual one-upmanship. But Paul gives us a different metric: faithfulness, humility, God-given authority, and Christ-exalting boasting.</p>
<p>🔍 Whether you're a church leader, a parent, or a young believer wrestling with comparison, this sermon offers rich, biblical clarity and deep encouragement.</p>
<p> </p>

Sermon Text: 2 Corinthians 10:12-18


1. We don’t measure ourselves by those who commend themselves (2 Cor 10:12)
2. We don’t boast beyond the limits that God has allotted to us (2 Cor 10:13-14)
3. We don’t take credit for the work that others have done (2 Cor 10:15-16)
4. We boast in the Lord and live for His approval (2 Cor 10:17-18)

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>As we enter a new year, Pastor Brandon Scroggins calls us to step back and ask a foundational question: Where are we going—and why? In this sermon, we examine the biblical DNA, covenantal commitments, and mission of Reformation Baptist Church.</p>
<p>Drawing from Scripture, church history, and the powerful example of King Alfred the Great, this message lays out the aim, trajectory, and calling of the Christian life—both individually and corporately. This is a call to intentional living, covenant faithfulness, sacrificial love, and joyful obedience under the lordship of Christ.</p>
<p>This sermon unpacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The purpose of the local church</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why covenant membership matters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How Christians are called to love Christ supremely</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What it means to care for one another as a covenant family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why every believer is saved to serve</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The centrality of family worship and discipleship</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mission of gospel witness to the nations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walking faithfully in a decaying culture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trusting God’s sovereignty as we march forward together</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“We are not saved to sit. We are saved to serve.”
May God grant us grace to be faithful with the one life He has given us—for His glory and our good.</p>

<p>Pastor Brandon walks through our church covenant, revisits the resolutions of Jonathan Edwards, and casts a vision for 2026 rooted in Scripture, prayer, holiness, and joyful, gospel-centered mission.

📅 Date: Sunday, November 9, 2025
🎙️ Preacher: Pastor Brandon Scroggins
📍 Reformation Baptist Church – Central Alabama</p>
<p>What defines a truly successful church? Is it buildings, budgets, and baptisms—or is it something far deeper? In this expositional sermon from 2 Corinthians 8:1–9, Pastor Brandon Scroggins leads us through Paul’s exhortation to the Corinthian church to complete their offering to the struggling believers in Jerusalem. Along the way, we are challenged to examine the marks of maturity in our own lives and church: faith, speech, knowledge, earnestness, and love.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the sermon draws our attention to the gospel-centered motivation behind all true generosity: the self-emptying love of Christ. Though He was rich, He became poor so that we might become eternally rich through His grace.</p>

Sermon Title: “Depression: Hope when Life Seems Hopeless”
Sermon Text: Psalms 42-43
1. The desperation of hopelessness:
Tears shed from a distant God and a dissolved gladness (vv. 1-6)
2. The declaration present God of hopefulness:
Trust declared in a present God and a future gladness (vv. 6b-11)
3. Dependence upon God for hope when life seems hopeless (Psalm 43:1-5)
The Condition of Depression: Anguish in a Heart of Struggle
The Cause of Depression: Life in a World of Sin
The Cure for Depression: Faith in the Sinless Savior

In this deeply pastoral and theologically rich sermon, Pastor Brandon Scroggins of Reformation Baptist Church (Wetumpka, AL) exposits Psalm 42 &amp; 43, tackling one of the most honest and difficult realities of the Christian life—depression. With vivid illustrations from church history, biblical exposition, and gospel hope, Pastor Brandon reminds believers that when life seems hopeless, our only true anchor is to hope in God. From the story of hymn-writer William Cowper, to the honest cries of the Psalmist, and the encouragement of saints who endured persecution, this sermon addresses the often unspoken “dark, dirty secret of the church”: that faithful Christians can experience deep seasons of despair—and still be held by God's sovereign hand. Whether you're walking through darkness yourself or seeking to care for others in the valley, this message brings hope, clarity, and gospel-centered counsel. 📖 Scripture Focus: Psalm 42 &amp; Psalm 43

Whether you're walking through darkness yourself or seeking to care for others in the valley, this message brings hope, clarity, and gospel-centered counsel. 📖 Scripture Focus: Psalm 42 &amp; Psalm 43

<p>In this expositional sermon from 2 Corinthians 8:3–5, Pastor Brandon Scroggins dives deep into the biblical view of money, stewardship, and heart-level priorities. The message, titled "First Things First," unpacks how genuine faith transforms our attitude toward giving, wealth, and trust in God. With biblical insights from Genesis to Revelation, Pastor Brandon shows that how we handle money is a spiritual matter—rooted in worship and faith, not just economics.</p>
<p>This sermon challenges cultural entitlement and encourages believers to joyfully and sacrificially give—first to the Lord and then to one another—demonstrating a rightly ordered life under the Lordship of Christ.</p>

<p>“Godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret.” In this expositional sermon, Pastor Brandon Scroggins walks us through 2 Corinthians 7:10–11, unpacking the nature and evidence of true repentance versus worldly sorrow. What does godly grief look like? How can we tell if repentance is genuine — in ourselves or in others?</p>
<p>In this message, Pastor Brandon carefully explains the seven fruits of genuine repentance, rooted in the gospel of Jesus Christ. With theological depth and pastoral warmth, we are exhorted to examine ourselves, embrace repentance as a gift of grace, and be renewed in gospel assurance.</p>

In 2 Cor 7:10-11,
we see 4 Ways God redeems the pain brought on by our sin, when submitted to Him:


1. The End of Godly Grief: Repentance &amp; Salvation
(2 Cor 7:10)


2. The Beginning of Genuine Repentance: Fruit &amp; Faithfulness
(2 Cor 7:11-12)


3. The Refreshment of Laboring Saints: Comfort &amp; Joy
(2 Cor 7:13)


4. The Hope of a Struggling Church: Obedience &amp; Humility
(2 Cor 7:14-16)

<p>In this powerful and deeply pastoral exposition from 2 Corinthians 7:1–4, Pastor Brandon Scroggins calls us to consider the cleansing power of God’s covenant promises. With urgency and tenderness, Paul exhorts believers to cleanse themselves from every defilement of body and spirit, open their hearts to faithful ministry, bind their souls to Christ’s people, and serve the church in sacrificial love.</p>
<p>This sermon speaks directly to the spiritual health of the local church, the often fragile relationship between pastor and congregation, and the need for genuine, covenantal unity rooted in the fear of God. As Pastor Brandon reminds us, all the promises of God find their “Yes” in Christ—and that motivates holiness, love, and long-suffering service among the body of Christ.</p>

From the influence of Isaac Watts and the origins of “Joy to the World,” to a stirring exploration of Psalm 98 as a kingship psalm, this message walks through the text in three key movements: singing to the Savior for His salvation, singing to the King with celebration, and singing to the Judge in anticipation.</p>
<p>You’ll be reminded of the central role of singing in the life of the believer and the gathered church—how it is both a declaration of doctrine and an act of spiritual warfare.

<p>From Genesis to Revelation, Scripture reveals that children are a precious blessing from God—and the focus of a relentless war from the enemy. In this sermon, Pastor Brandon Scroggins addresses the biblical blessing of children, the spiritual and cultural war against them, and the urgent need for the church to step up in defense of the next generation.</p>
<p>Through passages from Psalm 127-128, Malachi, Matthew, Revelation, and more, we are reminded that our children are heritage, reward, and arrows in the hands of a warrior—crafted to glorify Christ in the world. We are called to protect, disciple, and launch them into God’s mission.</p>
<p>This message also confronts modern cultural assaults on children: abortion, indoctrination, exploitation, chosen childlessness, and the undermining of biblical family structure. The call is clear—families, grandparents, and the local church must work together to train children in the fear of the Lord and guard them from the enemy’s schemes.</p>
<p>📖 Passages include: Psalm 127-128, Malachi 2:15, Matthew 2, Revelation 12, Ephesians 6, Deuteronomy 6, James 1:27, and more.</p>

From Genesis to Revelation, Scripture reveals that children are a precious blessing from God—and the focus of a relentless war from the enemy. In this sermon, Pastor Brandon Scroggins addresses the biblical blessing of children, the spiritual and cultural war against them, and the urgent need for the church to step up in defense of the next generation.
Through passages from Psalm 127-128, Malachi, Matthew, Revelation, and more, we are reminded that our children are heritage, reward, and arrows in the hands of a warrior—crafted to glorify Christ in the world. We are called to protect, disciple, and launch them into God’s mission.
This message also confronts modern cultural assaults on children: abortion, indoctrination, exploitation, chosen childlessness, and the undermining of biblical family structure. The call is clear—families, grandparents, and the local church must work together to train children in the fear of the Lord and guard them from the enemy’s schemes.
📖 Passages include: Psalm 127-128, Malachi 2:15, Matthew 2, Revelation 12, Ephesians 6, Deuteronomy 6, James 1:27, and more.

In today’s sermon, Pastor Brandon Scroggins exposits 2 Corinthians 6:1–5 in a message titled “Now Is the Time.” This passage delivers an urgent call to receive God’s grace with faith, to endure in trials, and to recognize the true credentials of faithful Christian ministry.
Rooted in the context of Paul’s heartfelt plea to the Corinthian church, this sermon challenges believers to avoid receiving God’s grace in vain. Pastor Brandon walks us through how genuine ministers suffer, labor, and persevere, not for the praise of man but for the glory of God. We are reminded that the present moment is the divinely appointed season of salvation and sanctification.

What is the true bullseye for the believer? How does walking by faith—not by sight—transform our priorities, decisions, and daily living? This message unpacks the biblical call to courage, Christ-centered ambition, and readiness for the judgment seat of Christ.

                                    <description><![CDATA[Join us for a powerful sermon from our special guest, John Huffman, as he unpacks Joshua 5 and the lessons of Gilgal—obedience, thanksgiving, and trust. Delivered at Reformation Baptist Church, this message challenges us to examine our faith, ensuring we are walking in God's will before we expect victory. In this sermon, John Huffman emphasizes the three crucial lessons Joshua learned at Gilgal. First, obedience in the present—Joshua had to follow God's command even when it seemed illogical. Second, thanksgiving for the past—the Israelites were called to remember and celebrate God's past deliverance through the Passover. Third, trust in God for the future—after entering the Promised Land, the manna ceased, and they had to rely on God’s new means of provision. The message also explores the historical significance of Gilgal, where God rolled away Israel’s reproach after 40 years of wandering. Huffman draws parallels to our own walk with Christ, reminding us that spiritual victories are won through obedience, gratitude, and faith. This is further illustrated in Joshua’s encounter with the Commander of the Lord’s Army, revealing God’s divine presence in the battle ahead.

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Join us for a powerful sermon from our special guest, John Huffman, as he unpacks Joshua 5 and the lessons of Gilgal—obedience, thanksgiving, and trust. Delivered at Reformation Baptist Church, this message challenges us to examine our faith, ensuring we are walking in God's will before we expect victory. In this sermon, John Huffman emphasizes the three crucial lessons Joshua learned at Gilgal. First, obedience in the present—Joshua had to follow God's command even when it seemed illogical. Second, thanksgiving for the past—the Israelites were called to remember and celebrate God's past deliverance through the Passover. Third, trust in God for the future—after entering the Promised Land, the manna ceased, and they had to rely on God’s new means of provision. The message also explores the historical significance of Gilgal, where God rolled away Israel’s reproach after 40 years of wandering. Huffman draws parallels to our own walk with Christ, reminding us that spiritual victories are won through obedience, gratitude, and faith. This is further illustrated in Joshua’s encounter with the Commander of the Lord’s Army, revealing God’s divine presence in the battle ahead.

<p>Join Pastor Brandon Scroggins of Reformation Baptist Church as we take a break from Jonah and dive into Psalm 98, which inspired Isaac Watts' hymn, "Joy to the World." This Christmas-focused sermon celebrates the incarnation of Christ while anticipating His glorious second coming. Learn how this psalm calls us to worship the Savior for His salvation, celebrate the King, and sing to the Judge in anticipation of His perfect rule.</p>
<p>This message also reflects on the rich theology of Christmas, highlighting the victory of Christ over sin, His role as the fulfillment of God's promises, and the hope of His eternal reign. Let’s rejoice in the wonders of His love and the truth of His gospel!</p>

Sermon Text: Psalm 98


In Psalm 98, we:


1.) Sing to the Savior for His Salvation (vv. 1-3)


2.) Sing to the King with Celebration (vv. 4-6)


3.) Sing to the Judge in Anticipation (vv. 7-9)
