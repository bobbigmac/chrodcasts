Looking at Psalm 139 and introducing the Prayer of Examen, this message offers a practical way to reconnect spiritually and become more aware of God's presence in everyday life. Many people ask:</p> <ul> <li>Why don't I feel close to God? </li> <li>Is God really with me? </li> <li>How do I reconnect through prayer? </li> </ul> <p>This teaching shows how reflective prayer can help you see where God has already been at work in your life — and how He may be closer than you think.</p>]]></description>

Likes, comments, group chats, and constant online interaction promise connection, but often leave us unseen and unknown. The algorithm keeps us engaged, but it can quietly pull us away from the kind of relationships our souls actually need.</p> <p>In this message from the Starve the Algorithm, Feed the Soul series, Jeff Brodie explores why being connected isn't the same as being known — and how real, meaningful relationships are formed. Because the answer to loneliness isn't more connections. It's being deeply known by a few.</p> <p>👉 Connection doesn't heal loneliness. Being known does.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Christmas is supposed to feel peaceful… but what if it doesn't? What if your plans got disrupted, your year didn't turn out how you hoped, or peace feels completely out of reach?</p> <p>In Part 3 of our Christmas series His Name Shall Be Called, Christine Birch looks at the night the angels appeared to the shepherds and announced the birth of Jesus — the Prince of Peace. But the story starts with fear, interruption, and uncertainty, not calm and quiet. This message reframes peace in a powerful way: peace isn't the absence of chaos — it's the presence of God with you.</p> <p>Whether your Christmas feels messy, heavy, lonely, or overwhelming, this message offers a deeper, more lasting peace than perfect circumstances ever could. If you're craving peace but your life feels anything but peaceful, this one's for you.</p>]]></description>

And the Father ran toward them both.</p> <p>What if the church looked like that kind of love? At Connexus, we believe the church shouldn't just be a place for people who get it all right. It should be a place for people who are real — real about their doubts, their struggles, their pride, and their pain. Because the church isn't a club for the found.

Again after deep regret and distance from Jesus. But in both moments, Jesus invited him to trust. And what happened next?

      <description><![CDATA[<p>What if being religious isn't the answer?</p> <p>Most people think following Jesus is about being good, trying harder, or doing all the right spiritual things. But that's not what Jesus taught. In a late-night encounter with a religious leader named Nicodemus, Jesus flips everything upside down with one bold truth: you don't need a better version of yourself—you need a brand new you.</p> <p>Whether you've walked away from religion, feel stuck in guilt, or wonder if God could ever accept you, this message is for you. Jesus' invitation isn't about self-improvement—it's about starting over. Not by trying harder, but by letting God make you new from the inside out.</p> <p> </p> <p><em>Clips from The Chosen are used with permission from Come & See Productions</em></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>What if experiencing a miracle isn't about formulas, prayers, or luck… but about posture? In Part 4 of Miracles: Then & Now, Andy Stanley challenges a common assumption about miracles: they aren't random, but they do happen where people position themselves in surrender to God's purposes. It's not about manipulating outcomes — it's about embracing trust even when it costs us something. If you've been wrestling with a big decision, wondering where God is, or hoping for something more — this message will help you reframe the conversation. Sometimes the miracle isn't what God does for you — it's what God does in you. </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Ready to flip the way most of us think about failure, pain, and hopelessness. At first glance, Jesus' death looked like the end of the story — brutal, unjust, and tragic. But what if it wasn't just a tragedy… what if it was actually a turning point?</p> <p class="p1">Think about the moments when life feels most broken — maybe something deeper is happening. What if the events surrounding Good Friday were about trust, hope, and a different kind of King who didn't come to take power, but to give His life for the sake of others.</p> <p class="p1">If you're feeling stuck, discouraged, or just wondering if there's something more, this message is for you. Maybe today could be a step toward a different kind of hope — the kind that doesn't depend on life going perfectly, but on someone who gave everything for you.</p> <p class="p1">👉 Watch and ask yourself: <em>Who — or what — sits on the throne of my heart?</em></p>]]></description>

Do miracles still happen? We'll look at what the scripture has to say. When you look for control and power outside of God you risk venturing outside of God's purpose. The greatest mistake you can make with the supernatural is to overestimate or underestimate its influence.

Do miracles still happen? We'll look at what the scripture has to say. When you look for control and power outside of God you risk venturing outside of God's purpose. The greatest mistake you can make with the supernatural is to overestimate or underestimate its influence. We invite you to join Jeff Brodie as he looks more into the supernatural.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Every family has its share of fights—some are icy and distant, while others are fiery and intense. Conflict is inevitable in any relationship, and disagreements happen at all ages. It can get heated in the moment. But the real question is, how do we fight with the end in mind? How do we fight for each other instead of with each other?

It seems like after we choose to follow Jesus, you're on a different kind of journey. You still wrestle with sin and you still struggle, so how is life supposed to be different? How come God doesn't just make us perfect right after we give our lives to him? Why do Christians sometimes struggle?

      <description><![CDATA[<p>There are moments in our lives that will define us. This is that type of moment for us as individuals and as a church. We've seen the heart of God by looking at what he searches for and what he celebrates - but how will we respond? Let's join him on the mission of being FOR those around us and welcoming them home. Like the early church, in the power of the Holy Spirit, let's show people that they matter to us, and most of all, they matter to God. </p> <p> </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We all need help—help from friends and help from Jesus to address the deepest need of the human heart. When you experience something that changes everything, you can't help but share it. As Jesus journeyed toward the cross and the tomb, different people along the way were invited to come and see. As his journey progressed, it became less clear what God was doing in the moment, but more clear to us today–clear that the invitation to come and see isn't just a physical one, it's a spiritual one. It's an invitation of forgiveness, hope, and freedom. It wasn't just news for a moment, but good news for all humanity. Good news for you, and it's definitely worth sharing.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>You are set apart from the world and for the world! In this message, Jeff Brodie looks at the role of societal lies; they tempt us to normalize the lies we hear in our lives so that we make the mistake of living them. He'll be looking at how scripture teaches us to spot the lies in our society and how we don't need to run from the world but run towards it.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In part 2 of the "Living with Yourself" video series, Andy Stanley stresses the importance of monitoring one's heart to ensure alignment between one's inner self and outer behavior. He emphasizes that man-made rules are not enough to live a life of integrity and that one must focus on the inner condition of their heart to align themselves with God's will. Stanley also discusses the dangers of ignoring what is going on inside oneself and the importance of tending to one's soul to prevent toxic emotions such as guilt, anger, greed, and jealousy from defiling it. Lastly, he addresses the issues of resentment, greed, and jealousy, suggesting that forgiveness, celebrating others' success, and giving generously are the solutions to these problems.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this podcast, Andy Stanley emphasizes the importance of attending to the health of our souls and surrendering ourselves to God to safeguard ourselves against the capacity for duplicity that can harm ourselves and our loved ones. He explores the concept of surrendering ourselves to Jesus every single day, declaring dependence and independence from oneself. Stanley argues that by following Jesus, people can close the gap between their self-image and how others perceive them, leading to peace with oneself and a life better lived. He also encourages people to practice daily surrender to sensitize their conscience and be less tolerant of going against who they truly want to be.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you were asked how Jesus lived his life on earth as a blessing, chances are you would say healings, the crucifixion, or preaching, but you probably wouldn't say eating. However, when you look at the life of Jesus he spent much of his time at parties connecting with people and serving them. What if the key to making an impact and rekindling relationships in our polarized society is as simple as having dinner together? What if at the heart of being human is humility itself?</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Over the last two years, your friendship circles have shrunk and your social skills have likely atrophied alongside them. On top of that, you can feel an awkwardness about some of your friends. Things seem more polarized, even divided. But here's what's exciting. As we rekindle relationships on the backside of restrictions, the Holy Spirit wants us to invite him into our conversations. It's not another task to do, but a way of intentionally being yourself. In this series, we'll be looking at the secret to authentically living out your faith in a way where you see God change your friend's lives as you live yours. It's not a program or even a radical change, it's the possibility that opens up with an intentional shift that anyone can make, and we're excited to share it with you.]]></description>

If this is true, isn't it worth breaking from the busyness of your life to listen to what he has to say, to learn from what he did? Don't you want to lean into the One who understands what it's like to be human?</p>]]></description>

The hope of lifted restrictions, perhaps the hope of a vaccine, the hope of a healthy diagnosis, or just hope for some good news in your life. You know what it means to wait for hope. Maybe you are still waiting. The accounts of Christmas are a picture of humanity holding out hope. The hope of something more, something better. ⁠</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>So you're attracted to the drama in other people's lives but resist it in your own. Agreed. It's so much easier to see the drama than it is to be the drama.</p> <p>It's also infinitely more disappointing and perhaps unfaithful. Moses knew that first hand. When God called him, he listed five reasons he wanted to stay out of the story. Five reasons he wanted out. He finally relented, and we're still talking about it thousands of years later. Lesson: God could use someone else, but what if you get to do it? </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Your desire to blame is an attempt to cover your shame. And there's a lot of shame circulating these days. Most people believe you can't be fully known and fully loved, so they hide and try to make themselves look better so people won't judge them.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>When Adam and Eve sinned, the accusations flew, and no one took responsibility. Not only did the blame start, so did the shame. For the first time, Adam and Eve realized they were naked. And they were ashamed. That sounds like a lot of relationships.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>When people say they hear from God, it can often feel like something foreign or even a bit odd. Do regular people hear from God?

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The kingdom of God is characterized by unsettling generosity —the kind of generosity that gives the undeserving what they don't deserve and regardless of how unright we've been, makes us right with God. So what do we do when we're faced with this math that doesn't add up? And how do we respond to this unfair, unsettling system that Jesus came to invite us into?</p>]]></description>

And where should you start if it's a word that was never part of the equation for you?</p>]]></description>

Sometimes we need resilience when people are difficult, and sometimes we need to keep fighting for a relationship with someone we love. Often we need resilience to navigate a relationship we didn't choose (like a co-worker or a neighbour). How do we bounce back when the gap grows between the reality of a relationship and the ideal that we would hope for? With conflict being a big part of relational challenges, how do we keep our composure? As we look at Paul's life the answer may not be what we think.</span></p>]]></description>

We have a tool that can be used to build up those around us or tear them down in just a few words. What do we do with that kind of power? We can't lock it away. But we can, by God's grace, learn to control it.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We all know what it's like to be hurt by someone who just couldn't listen long enough to understand us. Maybe in their attempt to be right, they damaged a relationship that could have been saved with a little patience and curiosity. You've probably been on the other side of that coin too. Taking the verbal offense may have won the argument but you lost relationally. What if we didn't settle for being right, but tried to make things right instead? The longer we listen the more we learn, and the better chance we have of protecting ourselves from our own big mouths.</p>]]></description>

So often evil seems to be winning, and so many people are angry at God for letting that happens. It's a good point. If God is so loving, why does he allow so much evil and suffering? While that question is difficult to answer convincingly, God does something more spectacular and powerful with evil. Eventually, evil self-destructs. And when evil throws itself at God, he does something unbelievable with it.</p>]]></description>

Are people inherently good, or a mixed bag? Is there a limit to human progress? And if we're so enlightened, why do we keep almost destroying ourselves again and again?</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you're stressed, worried or even anxious. What's going on? Well, if you dig a little deeper, it's like your stress and anxiety are tied to a rope that has something at the end….often, something that's hidden from you. What's at the end of your rope can tell you a lot about why you worry and how to reduce your anxiety.</span></p>]]></description>

And if it is, what's it like? We'll share 5 misconceptions about heaven in this message, and look at what scripture points us toward.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>What do you do when you have bad blood with someone who owes you something? Bad blood is costly and complicated. It costs you peace and complicates your other relationships. If you don't find peace in that "bad blood" relationship, your other relationships will suffer. The good news is that you can have peace about the relationship even without peace in the relationship.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Bad blood can infect any relationship. And the quality of our lives is only as good as the quality of our relationships. Lack of peace about a relationship robs you of peace in your own life. But you can have peace about a relationship even without peace in the relationship. Happiness comes from peace with God, peace with yourself, and peace with others.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If God is love, why do people
often feel so hopeless? Perhaps it's because we tie our hope to
circumstances and emotions. God invites us to tie our circumstances
to something profoundly different. Even something
unshakable.</span></p>]]></description>
