            <title>Why You're Not Helpless, Reign in Life </title>
            <link>http://media.jerrysavelle.org/jsmivideo/1068.mp4</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Many believers, even those who have walked with God for years, are unaware of a vital biblical truth: through Jesus Christ, they have been given authority to reign in life. Drawing from foundational scriptures such as Romans 5:17, Dr. Jerry Savelle teaches that life is not meant to have dominion over the believer. On the contrary, the believer is called to reign in life. Understanding this God-given authority changes how we speak, how we face challenges, and what we expect in our daily lives. We pray this series brings clarity and will transform your everyday Christian living! God bless you!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>God's Favor is for every believer in Christ Jesus — that's you!</p>

<p>In this series, Dr. Savelle teaches on the topic of how to continually live in the manifestations of God's Favor.  As believers in Christ (and living in the last days), we should expect to see God's Favor profusely abound in our lives today!  This is not only for the preacher or the pastor at your local church.  This is for everyone who is apart of the body of Christ!</p>

<p>Let the favor of God in your life become more than a testimony that only happens every once in a while.  Instead, let it be your daily reality through the receiving of God's Word.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[In this series, Jerry teaches that we have a Covenant of Increase with God! This covenant dates back to Genesis when He (God) made a covenant with Abraham “…I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.” We are Abraham’s seed and are heirs to this covenant and promise. God commanded us to increase exceedingly. For us to fail or lack is a violation of our covenant. God wants to bring increase to every area of our lives!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[God has many promises in His Word assuring that He has designed a life of victory for the Believer, including the scripture in 2 Corinthians 12:9 which says, "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness..." However, most Christians today who love God are living below their level of victory that God wants for their lives. If God's grace is sufficient, why don't more of us walk in the fact that we're immune to failure? Dr. Jerry Savelle has a powerful series for you on how to raise your expectation in God to see victory in every area of your life, how to stand on the Word until your circumstances change, and how vital it is to develop a no-quit attitude if you're going to live a life free from failure.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[God has called us to live a life without limits. Unfortunately, one of the biggest hinderances we can face are the ones we create ourselves by placing limits on what God can do in our lives. Often times we let doubt and unbelief creep in and rob us. In this series, brother Jerry shows through scripture, how our level expectancy is directly linked to the level of blessing we walk in. Turn up your expectancy and start living a life without limits today!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[God wants you to be an aggressive harvester.  All too often Christians are amazing sowers, but collectively fail to harvest what is rightfully theirs.

Watch this series again and again, so you too can walk in the abundant harvest God has for you!]]></description>

            <link>http://media.jerrysavelle.org/jsmivideo/0707.mp4</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The Bible says “All things are possible to them that believe.” Are you a believer? Then you must make the quality decision that quitting is no longer an option, and that failure is unacceptable. You must overcome the temptation to quit. I learned a long time ago, when you're under the greatest pressure to quit, that's always an indication Satan just fired his best shot!  And if this one doesn't get you, he's finished and you win!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[1st John 5:4 says, “…whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.” The Word says we are overcomers, and God will never say it's over until you win, but how do you continue to stand while the battle is still going? In this teaching, Dr. Jerry Savelle takes us through to the Word to show us how to conquer the temptation to quit, how to stay in faith for our victory, how to stay focused on God by developing patience, and why we should make the decision to never quit.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[In 2 Corinthians 4:13, the apostle Paul says, "We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written..." It is one thing to simply hear the word of faith taught but it is something completely different to catch the spirit of faith - not just having head knowledge but having the God-kind of faith cultivated down deep in you heart. We become "doers" of the Word (not just "hearers") when we go past just knowing what faith is to putting faith-filled words into action!

            <description><![CDATA[Don't Quit! Apostle Paul said "Having done all to stand, stand therefore". He stood strong for what he believed and near the end of his life he could say, "I have fought a good fight. I have kept the faith, I have finished my course...and there is a crown of righteousness waiting for me." He refused to quit! Make your decision today that "quit" is not an option. Two of Brother Jerry's favorite scriptures are Micah 7:8  "Rejoice not against me, O my enemy! When I fall, I shall arise..." and Proverbs 24:16 "For a just man falls seven times, and rises up again..." No matter what fiery darts might come your way, no matter how many times you might get knocked down, GET UP, DON'T QUIT!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[God’s plan for us is to have a flourishing lifestyle. In Proverbs 28:20 it says “A faithful man shall abound with blessings:” and in Deuteronomy 28:2 “…all these blessing shall come on thee, and overtake thee…” So if God is looking for faithfulness, our pursuit should be faithfulness. The result of faithfulness is, the blessings will began pursuing you. Remember it says, "these blessing shall come on thee, and overtake thee". It didn't say, "You'll come on them and overtake them." If you're doing what God wants you to do, if you're faithful at it, then the blessings will hunt you down and they'll come on you, they'll overtake you and you will flourish in the blessings!]]></description>

            <itunes:summary>God’s plan for us is to have a flourishing lifestyle. In Proverbs 28:20 it says “A faithful man shall abound with blessings:” and in Deuteronomy 28:2 “…all these blessing shall come on thee, and overtake thee…” So if God is looking for faithfulness, our pursuit should be faithfulness. The result of faithfulness is, the blessings will began pursuing you. Remember it says, "these blessing shall come on thee, and overtake thee". It didn't say, "You'll come on them and overtake them." If you're doing what God wants you to do, if you're faithful at it, then the blessings will hunt you down and they'll come on you, they'll overtake you and you will flourish in the blessings!</itunes:summary>

            <description><![CDATA[In this series, Jerry Savelle's daughter, Terri Savelle Foy explains the importance to dream and have a vision for your life. If you don't have a vision or dreams for your life than you're just existing. In Proverbs 29:18 it says, Where there is no vision, the people perish. You have to know where you are headed before you can start taking steps towards it. Give yourself permission to dream! Don't let the devil tell you that you're to young, to old, made to many mistakes, not smart enough, etc. Look at all that is ahead of you not what is behind you. God still wants to use you, he has a plan for your life.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Is these messages, Dr. Savelle shares his insight that although God wants to manifest His glory in our lives, it doesn’t just happen. We have a part to play. We need to hunger for it, pray for it, and believe for it. God's glory is the manifested presence of God, power of God and goodness of God. When you experience God's glory you can overcome every situation the enemy could ever throw at you. It is the answer and solution to whatever you are facing!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The Joy of the Lord is your strength! It doesn't matter what kind of obstacle the devil throws before you. If you are willing tap into the force of joy that the Spirit of God has placed in each believer you can walk in victory. In John 15:1-11, Jesus reminds us to focus on him not the surroundings, and if we do our joy will remain and be full!]]></description>
