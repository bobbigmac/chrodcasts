Evan addresses the ways in which lay persons can get involved in church leadership, the role of emotional intelligence and the ability to be honest as church leaders. He also offers advice on prayers for our loved ones who have or are leaving the church and faith. He recommends the Akathist to Jesus, Light to Those in Darkness, and answers questions about feeling less than worthy and on how God can use our interests to pursue His calling in our lives.</itunes:summary></item><item><pubDate>Mon, 21 Dec 2020 15:10:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:date>2020-12-21T15:10:00+00:00</dc:date><title>200th Episode Celebration!</title><guid>https://www.ancientfaith.com/podcasts/orthodoxylive/200th_episode_celebration/?id=46862</guid><description>We celebrate the 200th episode of Orthodoxy Live with call-ins from Dr. Jeannie Constantinou, Fr.
