On Jan 30, 2024, Ancient Faith Today released an audio documentary entitled The Orthodox Deaconess: Examining the Call for Restoration. In that 1 hour and 45 minute documentary there were 16 diverse voices heard representing Orthodox Christians who were both in favor and opposed to the restoration. 

In this episode of Ancient Faith Today, you will be able to hear the complete interviews or comments of all 16 individuals. The timestamps below will help you find the ones you are most interested in hearing. 

As we mentioned in the documentary, our goal was to provide a forum for responsible, respectful discussion that furthers the Ancient Faith Ministries’ mission to educate, edify, and evangelize. While we never intend to present material that is not in line with the teachings of the Orthodox Church, there are topics where the Church does not have a unified stated position. And this is true of this topic. People have conflicting opinions about the history and function of the female diaconate and whether that role should be restored today. In light of that you need to know that we at Ancient Faith do not necessarily endorse the opinions of all the people we interviewed. We do however express our gratitude for their willingness to speak to us.
