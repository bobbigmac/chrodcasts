<p>Treasure hunt is the best way to describe the whirlwind afternoon that I spent at campus and community radio station <a href="https://www.cjsf.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CJSF 90.1 FM</a> at Simon Fraser University (SFU) in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada in June 2025. Every inch of the station tells a story. Guided by Music Coordinator Connor Ashton and Programming Coordinator Jesse Wentzloff, we toured through shelves of records, checked out drawers of 7&#8243;s, peered into boxes of early community radio conference documents, and reminisced about bands and events. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Touring CJSF&#8217;s Living Archive</h2>



<p>Even though CJSF moved to its current basement space in the Student Union Building just five years ago in 2021, the station feels lived in and full of history. Thankfully, CJSF brought tens of thousands of records into its new home, along with amazing archival material and objects from its many decades of existence, including sticker-covered cabinets.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CJSF-file-cabs-IMG_3147.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CJSF-file-cabs-IMG_3147-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-52639" srcset="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CJSF-file-cabs-IMG_3147-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CJSF-file-cabs-IMG_3147-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CJSF-file-cabs-IMG_3147-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CJSF-file-cabs-IMG_3147.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>File drawers full of records at CJSF. Photo: J. Waits</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>However, not all the stickers made it to the new location. &#8220;One of our biggest losses in the move was that the door to the studio was just covered in a multi-layer patina of the stickers. And&#8230;we couldn&#8217;t bring it with us because it didn&#8217;t fit in,&#8221; Wentzloff shared. Despite that loss, there are still plenty of sticker-covered shelves and cabinets at CJSF. Within the layers of decals, I was shocked to see one from the early 1990s from a friend&#8217;s obscure record label, Electro Motive Records. And then after searching within the station&#8217;s music database, we found a few releases from that label from the same vintage. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cassettes in the CJSF Archives</h2>



<p>So much material within the walls of CJSF reflects various moments of college radio&#8217;s trajectory &#8212; from music magazines to cassettes documenting local bands to hand-written playlists to promotional flyers to board meeting minutes transmitted in the beginning days of email. All of that history is lovingly cared for at CJSF. Wentzloff noted that 1990s era cassettes had recently been unearthed from storage, prompting a project to organize them and even feature some on air. The resulting show, &#8220;<a href="https://www.cjsf.ca/contents/analog-archives" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Analog Archives</a>,&#8221; was in the works at the time of my visit and led to the production of episodes highlighting gems from the CJSF collection.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CJSF&#8217;s Large Physical Music Library</h2>



<p>CJSF maintains a massive music library with around 92,000 items, including approximately 50,000 CDs, 25,000 vinyl records, around one thousand cassette tapes, and the remainder digital music files. Ashton said that CJSF receives around 400 to 500 albums a month and adds perhaps 150 to 200 of them. Volunteers help to review incoming music and Ashton happily shared, &#8220;I have a cadre of wonderful folks who listen and tag.&#8221; Additionally, a weekly CJSF record club utilizes a dedicated listening station at CJSF. Similar to a book club, this group meets to chat about and listen to music.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Music Discovery in the CJSF Library through Color Codes</h2>



<p>While the vinyl collection is filed alphabetized, the CDs are given code numbers and are arranged chronologically, in the order that they were added to the library. Staff and volunteers can locate specific releases by searching through a database to find the corresponding code numbers. Ashton articulated the care taken with the library, saying, &#8220;We do our best to keep things organized, and I harp on putting things back where they should be, not just where you found them.&#8221;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CJSF-CD-codes-IMG_3063.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CJSF-CD-codes-IMG_3063-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-52645" srcset="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CJSF-CD-codes-IMG_3063-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CJSF-CD-codes-IMG_3063-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CJSF-CD-codes-IMG_3063-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CJSF-CD-codes-IMG_3063.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>CDs at CJSF.

</div>


<p>Additionally, DJs can get a sense of genres and other categories of interest by looking at color codes affixed to record spines. Posters on display at CJSF break down the color codes, which encompass not only genres but also station recommendations (&#8220;pick of the week&#8221;), Canadian content, Vancouver content, and material by female artists. CJSF also notes items that it considers &#8220;fair play&#8221; selections from under-represented groups including people of color, LGBTQ+, local indigenous artists, and folks with disabilities. Describing some of these category stickers as &#8220;discoverability tags,&#8221; Ashton explained that they hope to indicate &#8220;more than just what type of music it is, but also how it would relate to society and culture.&#8221;</p>

</div>


<p>With so much physical media, CJSF encourages DJs to utilize the library, which they do. Vinyl gets played and the studios are outfitted with working turntables, cassette decks and CD players, as well as bluetooth and DJ mixing tools. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CJSF Schedule includes Mix of Music and Talk Shows </h2>



<p>CJSF welcomes both student and non-student members. Currently there are around 80 to 90 volunteers, with about 50 percent students. Both Wentzloff and Ashton are long-time participants and show hosts, with Wentzloff starting off as a volunteer in 2009, before eventually moving into various staff positions. He&#8217;s one of the hosts of &#8220;<a href="https://www.cjsf.ca/contents/vancouver-mixtape" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vancouver Mix Tape</a>,&#8221; which focused on the Vancouver independent music scene. Ashton hosts a chiptune/video game music show, &#8220;<a href="https://www.cjsf.ca/contents/bitcouver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcouver</a>.&#8221; He has been in his role in the music department for 4 years and has been a volunteer for over 8 years.</p>

</div>


<p>Ever since the move to the Student Union building, CJSF has had to restrict live shows to between the hours of 9am and 10pm. That means that from 10pm to 9am all the programming must be pre-recorded. Shows are a mix of music and spoken word, including some syndicated programming. The range of music played includes metal, jazz, hip-hop, experimental, punk, post-punk, screamo, local independent music and more. Talk programming includes syndicated shows like &#8220;Democracy Now&#8221; and &#8220;Alternative Radio,&#8221; as well as a number of CJSF-produced shows focusing on the arts (&#8220;The Arts Show&#8221;), news, and more. &#8220;<a href="https://www.cjsf.ca/contents/speak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speak Up!</a>&#8220;, an hour-long public affairs and talk magazine show produced by CJSF, airs three mornings a week. Recent episodes include interviews with artists, pieces about recent local protests, and guests sharing details about Black History Month events. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Digging into the History of CJSF</h2>



<p>Today, CJSF broadcasts reach the greater Vancouver area over 90.1 FM and cover the world through its internet stream. However, in the early years of campus radio at Simon Fraser, transmissions were limited to the college. According to a station history on the CJSF website, &#8220;CJSF Radio has been around since the early days of Simon Fraser University, first as a music club, then an oddball, unlicensed radio station that was heard from a series of speakers placed around the campus.&#8221; </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CKSF Launches in Fall 1966 as Closed-Circuit Station</h2>



<p>Brian Antonson helped launch the first radio station at SFU in fall 1966. In a <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/earlyarts/Music-Sound/cjsf--brian-antonson-went--on-the-air--in-fall-1966.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">piece for the university website</a>, he shares his recollections, writing, &#8220;I was a brand new 1st-year student&#8230;To my delight, nobody had yet started a campus radio station at SFU, which was then only a year old.&#8221; He quickly worked with other students to organize a meeting, obtain equipment, and get permission to use a janitor&#8217;s closet as the station&#8217;s home. Using CKSF as their call letters (for &#8220;Canadian Kilocycles, Simon Fraser&#8221; according to <a href="https://broadcasting-history.ca/radio/radio-stations/british-columbia/british-columbia-vancouver/cjsf-fm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a piece from the Canadian Communications Foundation</a>), members of the station initially played records for people who congregated in the nearby Rotunda. The broadcasts were carried by wire to speakers. In it first year, programming aired on weekdays from 10am to 4pm at the minimum, including music shows, news, interviews, and reports from rallies and speeches. <a href="https://digital.lib.sfu.ca/peak-wednesday-february-14-1973" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">By 1973, CKSF&#8217;s schedule</a> was packed with shows from 9am to midnight on weekdays.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1970s: Simon Fraser Campus Radio Society and CSFU Continue Campus-Only Broadcasts</h2>



<p>In 1974 the Simon Fraser Campus Radio Society was established. In Fall 1976, SFU&#8217;s student newspaper <em>The Peak</em> <a href="https://digital.lib.sfu.ca/peak-friday-october-1-1976">wrote</a> of the former CKSF&#8217;s return to the air (after a six month absence) with new call letters CSFU. By 1980, the station could be heard in a few places on campus. As described in a <a href="https://digital.lib.sfu.ca/peak-tuesday-september-30-1980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 30, 1980 article</a> in <em>The Peak</em>, the station &#8220;operates on a broadcasting system known as &#8216;in-house distribution.&#8217; This permits them to be heard only in the rotunda, the South court lounge, the East concourse cafeteria, the CNIB, and hopefully soon, the Pub.&#8221; Ever since CKSF&#8217;s launch in 1966, plans were afoot to expand even further, with the goal of switching to campus-only AM carrier current and eventually to FM. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1980s: Call Letter Change to CJIV, Launch of AM Carrier Current Transmissions and Cable FM</h2>



<p>In the summer of 1981, carrier current was on the horizon for the station. In preparation, it announced in <a href="https://digital.lib.sfu.ca/peak-wednesday-june-24-1981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an article</a> in <em>The Peak</em> that its call letters were changing to CJIV, with plans to begin broadcasts that September. It&#8217;s unclear if it met that deadline, but in <a href="https://digital.lib.sfu.ca/peak-thursday-september-9-1982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 1982</a> <em>The Peak</em> reported that CJIV could be heard in campus residences over 650 AM. A few years later CJIV was approved for cable FM and was expected to launch over 94.5 FM in November 1985. Schedules from 1986 indicate that CJIV was broadcasting sporting events and playing alternative music over cable FM as planned. A June 1986 CJIV Top 40 list includes albums from Butthole Surfers, The Connells, Big Black, Cocteau Twins, and more.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1992 and Beyond: Call Letters Change to CJSF, with Debut of 90.1 FM Broadcasts in 2003</h2>



<p>In January 1992, CJIV <a href="https://digital.lib.sfu.ca/peak-thursday-january-23-1992-page-2#back-to:/search?keywords=CJIV%20&amp;sort_by=edtf_year&amp;sort_order=DESC&amp;items_per_page=15&amp;f%5B0%5D=descendant_of%3A45&amp;include_fulltext=1&amp;page=25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changed its call letters</a> to CJSF &#8220;in an effort to be taken more seriously&#8221; and was broadcasting over 93.9 cable FM. And in 2003, CJSF reached another milestone when it finally hit the terrestrial airwaves at 90.1 FM, after securing an FM license. Evidence of the station&#8217;s shifting call letters and frequencies can be seen while looking through the record library in particular, with &#8220;CJIV&#8221; scrawled on albums from the 1980s. During the CJIV era, the station also ran a label called Three Minute Mile Records. We spotted a few of the early 7&#8243;s from the label on our tour, including brightly colored singles from Cat&#8217;s Game and Dirt.</p>

<p>While wandering through the collection of materials at CJSF, Ashton and Wentzloff reflected back on the wide variety of events, promotional items, and traditions from the station&#8217;s past. In some cases they are hoping to bring back things that used to happen, such as a regular feature in the student newspaper highlighting CJSF charts and album reviews. </p>

<p>Near the end of the visit, I was amused to see that amongst the typical college radio station staples (couches, disco ball, sticker-covered shelves, hand-made signage related to policies, etc.) there were also a number of plastic U.S. Postal Service mail bins being used for incoming and outgoing mail and to store music. Ashton remarked that they had dozens of them because they are &#8220;nice and sturdy&#8221; and are &#8220;good boxes for sorting and everything.&#8221; I see them used for those purposes at stations throughout the United States, but was surprised to see them in active use in Canada. Ashton wasn&#8217;t sure if Canada Post still made bins like that, but after looking around a bit, we saw a few similar ones at CJSF.</p>

<p>On a Sunday drive from Vancouver to Abbotsford, British Columbia last June, Aaron Levy narrated the landscape, pointing out locations used during the filming of various series (including some of my personal favorites: <em>Riverdale</em> and <em>Bates Motel</em>) in British Columbia. <a href="https://www.civl.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CIVL 101.7 FM</a>, where he serves as Executive Director, had its star turn in 2024, when the college radio outlet had a brief cameo in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31510901/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Danger in the Dorm</em></a>, a Lifetime movie that is notable in part because of the casting of former reality star Bethenny Frankel. Sadly, the radio station isn’t the site of peril or heroics in the film, but it makes for a fun bit of trivia for the campus and community station at University of the Fraser Valley (UFV). </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CIVL on Film </h2>



<p>After arriving on campus, Levy shared souvenirs from the film shoot, including goofy student activities flyers for a &#8220;Self-Love Social Club&#8221; and a &#8220;Volleyball Competition&#8221; and signage for the radio station at the fictional Brighton University. He said the flyers were &#8220;just things they put up to make it look like it&#8217;s a random campus community radio station.&#8221; The generic styling for the movie-version of CIVL (which had different call letters in <em>Danger in the Dorm</em>) is vastly different from the actual station, whose call letters and dial spot appeared adjacent to the words &#8220;semi-obscure&#8221; on Levy&#8217;s car radio display.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<p>However, the spirit of the &#8220;real&#8221; CIVL is captured in the 2025 documentary, <a href="https://www.civl.ca/counterculture-20-years-of-civl-radio-in-the-fraser-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Counterculture: 20 Years of CIVL Radio in the Fraser Valley</em></a>, which I caught at a screening during the <a href="https://ncrc.ncra.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Campus and Community Radio Conference</a> just a few days before visiting the station. In fact, that film and Levy&#8217;s passion for campus radio is what led me to venture out of the city for another radio field trip.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">History of CIVL Radio</h2>



<p>In 2003, the germ of an idea for a radio station at UFV began with the work of the Radio Station Development Committee. Student surveys at the time indicated great interest in launching a station and by 2005 a non-profit radio society was founded. Although an FM license was granted in 2006, CIVL didn&#8217;t take to the terrestrial airwaves until 2010. In the meantime, the station streamed online, beginning in 2008. Recently, CIVL expanded its broadcast range after receiving CRTC (Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission) approval in 2025 for a transmitter at 92.3 FM in Chilliwack, where UFV has an additional campus.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Touring CIVL at University of the Fraser Valley</h2>



<p>Located in the Student Union Building on UFV&#8217;s main campus, CIVL is upstairs in a high visibility area. Nearby, a CIVL banner hangs amongst the variety of flags from student organizations, nations and affinity groups displayed over the center atrium of the building. Passersby can peek into the studio and DJs can look out into the building and a campus eatery. Housed in this space since 2015, CIVL&#8217;s digs are full of a familiar mix of the old and the new. Music-related artifacts populate every room, including illustrated event posters and cabinets plastered with band and radio station stickers. </p>

<p>At around 20 years old, CIVL is one of the newest campus and community radio stations in Canada. Its studio is outfitted with some of the latest tech gear, including an inherited (yet barely used) industrial-looking sound board and automation software. But CIVL also cherishes music history and has a library full of LPs, 7&#8243; records, cassettes, and CDs, with many dating back to before the station began.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CIVL-cassette-IMG_2863.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CIVL-cassette-IMG_2863-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-52598" srcset="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CIVL-cassette-IMG_2863-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CIVL-cassette-IMG_2863-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CIVL-cassette-IMG_2863-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CIVL-cassette-IMG_2863.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Cassette tape in the CIVL library.

</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Music Library Runs the Gamut from Old to New</h2>



<p>The majority of the older records are located in the back of the station and are loosely organized in cabinets and shelves. Unfortunately after a station move a decade ago, CIVL ended up with less space, so the library is not as easy to navigate. As we poked around, the variety of records was fascinating. Stacks of 1950s and 1960s-era releases from Harry Belafonte, John Baez, Peter, Paul &amp; Mary, Perry Como and the Ventures were steps away from a Dixieland Jazz record and an LP from the Soviet Army Chorus. Decorative album covers propped in CIVL&#8217;s front window represent the 1970s and 1980s, with releases from Olivia Newton-John and The Cars alongside the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack and its parody Saturday Night Fiedler.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<p>Levy told me that not as many people use the records as he&#8217;d like, which isn&#8217;t that uncommon at stations with easy-to-use digital libraries. DJs are encouraged to play physical music and a &#8220;newest releases&#8221; bin contains some of the latest CDs added to the library, including albums by Contrived, Kelly McMichael, Veronica Lewis and Alana Yorke. People also frequently bring in their own music, including vinyl records. As is the case at other Canadian stations, CIVL must generally air 35% Canadian content, so there&#8217;s a big emphasis on supporting local artists. Recent <a href="https://www.civl.ca/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Top 30&#8221; lists</a> from CIVL lend credence to this emphasis on local, with the top 15 artists and 21 of the top 30 artists on the February 10, 2026 chart hailing from Canada. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fraser Valley Music Awards and Support of Local Music</h2>



<p>In addition to supporting local artists over the airwaves, CIVL has been hosting its annual <a href="https://fvma.civl.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fraser Valley Music Awards</a> since 2016. The event specifically focuses on artists local to the area and winners are recognized across a range of categories, including &#8220;artist of the year&#8221; in genres groupings organized around jazz/roots/blues, punk/metal, adult alternative, singer-songwriter, rock, experimental, country, electronic, hip hop, pop, and RNB. Nominees and winners are all featured on the CIVL website, with links to their music.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Broad Music and Programming Mix on CIVL</h2>



<p>The variety of genres covered by the Fraser Valley Music Awards is representative of the breadth of music played on CIVL. The schedule includes a mix of syndicated and locally-produced music and spoken word programming. Highlights include <a href="https://www.civl.ca/show/semiobscure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SemiObscure</a> (&#8220;hip-hop to harsh noise, top 40 to the underground&#8221;), <a href="https://www.civl.ca/show/zuba-zuba-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zuba Zuba Trio</a> (&#8220;three Japanese international students talk about the cultural differences between Japan and Canada&#8221;), <a href="https://www.civl.ca/show/naija-vibes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Naija Vibes</a> (music from Nigeria), and <a href="https://www.civl.ca/show/the-coleman-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Coleman Show</a> (talk show focused on hockey, including the Vancouver Canucks and the Abbotsford Canucks).</p>

<p>Additionally, this diversity of programming has garnered accolades over the years. Awards on display at CIVL include numerous trophies and certificates granted in recognition for music shows, public affairs programming and community service. There&#8217;s also a 1st place award for the 2009 Punk Bowlers Ball, which was held in Vancouver.</p>

<p>During my weekend visit, automation was running through a pre-set line-up of music. Levy said that most of the live in-person shows are on weekdays, typically in the mornings. Following the pandemic, many hosts now opt to pre-record their programming. Initially that was facilitated through an emergency relief grant from the Community Radio Fund of Canada. Thanks to that funding, CIVL purchased portable mixing consoles and microphones, which allowed programmers to produce show from home.</p>

<p>Located near the campus newspaper, The Cascade, CIVL also contributes a regular column, &#8220;<a href="https://ufvcascade.ca/category/arts-in-review/civl-shuffle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Shuffle</a>,&#8221; written by Levy. He&#8217;s been writing the column for 18 years and joked that he&#8217;s probably been published in the paper more than anyone else &#8220;because I never stopped.&#8221; Recent editions of &#8220;The Shuffle&#8221; are themed annotated playlists featuring music selections related to timely events or holidays, including the Superbowl, Black History Month and New Year&#8217;s. It&#8217;s a wonderful way for Levy to share his music taste, especially since he initially learned about campus radio when he was a college student at University of Guelph and was drawn to CFRU because it was &#8220;the room full of CDs.&#8221; He reminisced with me, saying that at the time he was into a range of artists, from Madlib to Yo La Tengo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep Nanaimo Weird&#8221; reads a piece of artwork on the wall of <a href="https://www.chly.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CHLY 101. 7 FM</a>, a campus and community radio station in Nanaimo, British Columbia in Canada. Affiliated with Vancouver Island University (formerly known as Malaspina College) &#8220;through its purpose and membership,&#8221; the station is located off-campus in Nanaimo&#8217;s historic downtown. Situated next to a community co-operative bike shop and in the basement of bar/music venue The Queen&#8217;s, CHLY is accessed through the back of the building on the charmingly-named Lois Lane.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">History of CHLY: From Conception to Streaming to FM</h2>



<p>A relatively young station, CHLY began streaming online in 2000 and took to the FM airwaves in fall 2001. It originated as a project of Malaspina College Professor John Black in 1990, when he helped to found the Nanaimo Education and Community Media Society. In 1997, The Radio Malaspina Society was formed. By 2008 the university began operating under the name Vancouver Island University.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10613/908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 1995 issue</a> of the Malaspina University-College newsletter, <em>Mainly Malaspina</em>, ran an article &#8220;Radio Malaspina Poised to Sign On&#8221; by its founder John Black. At the time the station was &#8220;on the brink of implementation as a closed-circuit operation on the Nanaimo campus,&#8221; Black writes. He describes the planned method, saying that the station hoped to transmit &#8220;over the campus cable system, so that it is accessible in lounges, classrooms and the cafeteria by plugging in a radio tuner to the campus cable outlet.&#8221; </p>

<p>Radio Malaspina began streaming online on April 1, 2000, while it awaited word about its application for a broadcast license (take a look at its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010216071133/http://radio.mala.bc.ca/chly/chly.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">old website</a> circa 2001 on the Wayback Machine) and officially launched as CHLY 101.7 FM on October 5, 2001. By 2008 the university began operating under the name Vancouver Island University, although the CHLY-FM license holding organization still utilizes the name Radio Malaspina Society.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Touring CHLY during the National Campus and Community Radio Association Conference </h2>



<p>My visit to CHLY in June, 2025 coincided with the <a href="https://ncrc.ncra.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Campus and Community Radio Association Conference</a> (NCRC), which was hosted by CHLY on the Vancouver Island University campus. During a welcome event, attendees were invited to the station for dinner and entertainment on the adjacent outdoor patio. Before the grill was fired up, I took a quick semi-self-guided tour of the station. Staff and volunteers were on hand to answer questions as folks from all over Canada wandered through to check out their space.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CHLY-buttons-IMG_2315.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CHLY-buttons-IMG_2315-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-52563" srcset="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CHLY-buttons-IMG_2315-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CHLY-buttons-IMG_2315-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CHLY-buttons-IMG_2315-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CHLY-buttons-IMG_2315.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>CHLY buttons at the registration table for the 2025 NCRC.

</div>


<p>One of the more unusual features of the station is a kitchen, which was certainly in use as CHLY members prepped to host dinner for a crowd. Exposed brick walls are visible near the station entrance, where a counter is filled with informational literature. An open area has desks for CHLY staff and volunteers. Overhead one can see a loft area that is used mainly for storage. </p>

<p>Proceeding down a hall towards the studio are shelves full of CDs. Filed in chronological order of their add date, the CDs are in the midst of being digitized by station volunteers. The on-air studio is tucked in the back of the space, near storage lockers and stairs that lead to a washroom. DJs are able to use turntables, CD players, as well as digital music that has been added to the CHLY library. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Programming Mix: Music, Spoken Word and News</h2>



<p>Most programming over CHLY is produced by local volunteers, with the schedule containing a mix of music and spoken word, as well as some syndicated shows. The wide mix of shows include &#8220;Midday Mozart&#8221; (classical music), &#8220;Into the Void&#8221; (underground, extreme and fringe music), &#8220;Queerly Beloved&#8221; (music and local interviews in the queer community), &#8220;Tuning Fork&#8221; (food and farm talk focused on local farmers), &#8220;Thrash Can&#8221; (thrash metal), and &#8220;Nash Holos Ukrainian Roots Radio&#8221; (arts, culture and news).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Field Trip to CHLY Transmitter Site on a Hill</h2>



<p>As an added bonus, I also traveled to the CHLY transmitter site on Cottle Hill in Nanaimo. At the end of a conference day, I hopped on a green propane-fueled bus with around ten other campus and community radio folks for the last-minute field trip. &#8220;Medieval Chaos&#8221; was painted on signs outside the bus and a bumper sticker inside read &#8220;My dragon can take your unicorn.&#8221; The whimsical messages provide clues to the bus&#8217; participation as a transport vehicle to live action role-playing games in the Nanaimo area. </p>

</div>


<p>Owned by the CHLY Technical Director, the bus carried us on a journey to a woodsy park on a hill north of the city. After a short walk to look at the transmitter shack and beholding the cluster of communication towers, our group of radio aficionados hiked up to the summit of the hill to take in the lovely view as the sun was setting.</p>

<p>Underground is more than a metaphor for countless college radio stations which may play edgier music but are also housed beneath the earth. I&#8217;ve seen many basement digs in my travels, but none quite like the subterranean space occupied by University of Victoria&#8217;s campus and community radio station <a href="https://cfuv.uvic.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CFUV 101.9 FM</a> in Victoria, British Columbia in Canada. Located on the lower level of the school&#8217;s modernist-brutalist Student Union Building (the SUB), the station&#8217;s windows face an angled concrete wall. When looking out of the CFUV offices and studio, it feels a bit like you are observing the world from the bottom of a fish bowl. This is heightened by the presence of tables and chairs up above the moat-like well outside of the station windows. Although faces are hard to detect, dangling legs are visible from below. CFUV Station Manager Rowan Grice told me that this odd architecture has led to some atypical interactions with listeners, with some people climbing down the wall to deliver music requests to the on-air DJs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Welcoming Community at CFUV</h2>



<p>Promoting itself as &#8220;offbeat community-led radio since 1984,&#8221; CFUV is made up of both student and non-student participants who work &#8220;to provide an alternative to commercial radio&#8221; and &#8220;to uplift marginalized and underrepresented voices.&#8221; Volunteers are invited to not only host radio shows and podcasts, but are also provided training in audio and video production.  </p>

</div>


<p>Before even stepping into the station&#8217;s lobby, it was clear to me that CFUV was a welcoming space. A bulletin board in the hallway is decorated with five purple posters, each outlining different ways that one can participate at CFUV. The posters promote listening to the station, tuning in to podcasts, volunteering, submitting music, and following CFUV on social media. Additionally, hand-drawn speech bubbles reading &#8220;learn new skills,&#8221; &#8220;build community,&#8221; &#8220;play local,&#8221; and &#8220;collaborate&#8221; are affixed to the CFUV window, touting the benefits of joining the station. Just below the paper signs is a melted vinyl Ashlee Simpson record, a sign that says &#8220;Drop in and Say Hello!&#8221; and a QR code that links to a volunteer application.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CFUV Open House for NCRC Attendees</h2>



<p>During my June 2025 visit to CFUV, the station was buzzing with activity. I was amongst a large contingent of radio people who were in BC for the <a href="https://ncrc.ncra.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Campus and Community Radio Conference</a> (NCRC). As we all crammed into the station and chatted about radio, folks from CFUV led tours and answered questions about their lively station. Posters for past and future events blanket the studio walls, a well-organized record library is full of music, and a performance studio is set up for local and visiting musicians. Live performances take place every Friday afternoon during the &#8220;Basement Closet Sessions&#8221; show and archived episodes can be heard on the <a href="https://cfuv.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CFUV Bandcamp page</a> and viewed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cfuvradio/videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CFUV&#8217;s YouTube page</a>. An arrangement of Polaroid photos on the studio wall documents recent guest musicians and bands, including Bongwitch, Molly Pocket, Cistern, Stax, Steel Cut Oats and Ghost Darling.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Emphasis on Local Music, Curated Record Library</h2>



<p>Local material is emphasized at CFUV, which also must abide by Canadian Content (CanCon) regulations set by the Canadian Radio-television Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). According to the CRTC, &#8220;English-language and French-language stations must ensure that at least 35% of the Popular Music they broadcast each week is Canadian content.&#8221; Additional rules apply for &#8220;special interest music,&#8221; for which 12% of these selections on campus and community radio stations must be Canadian. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CFUV-CanCon-IMG_2093.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CFUV-CanCon-IMG_2093-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-52518" srcset="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CFUV-CanCon-IMG_2093-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CFUV-CanCon-IMG_2093-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CFUV-CanCon-IMG_2093-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CFUV-CanCon-IMG_2093.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>&#8220;What is Can Con&#8221; flyer on the wall of CFUV.

</div>


<p>For CFUV, with an ever-expanding record library, the decision was made to be more selective about adding physical music. Whereas the station is mostly adding digital releases, exceptions are made for local music and hard-to-find items. The physical library is organized in chronological order, based on when materials were added to the collection. In the past, the coding system was written down in books, so that DJs could search for a particular album&#8217;s designated number, but today the items are listed in a database accessed via a tablet. In addition to catalog numbers on the records and CDs, color codes indicate genres and CanCon selections. For CFUV, experimental music gets marked with a silver label and hip hop is marked with an orange label, for example. Additional two-letter codes are applied to  genres and Canadian content as well as releases produced by women (Wm), local artists (Lc), Indigenous artists (In), French materials (Fr) and soundtracks (Sk).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Diverse Programming Schedule</h2>



<p>As a result of this wide variety of music, the CFUV schedule is quite diverse and includes local and syndicated music and spoken word programming. Music shows encompass classical, jazz, blues, experimental, multicultural, metal, punk, folk, country, roots and electronic genres. Additionally, CFUV has a number of <a href="https://cfuv.uvic.ca/podcasts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">podcasts</a>, including several focusing on topics related to indigenous peoples and culture, one created by incarcerated artists (&#8220;Dark Traveller&#8221;), one presented by the independent student newspaper The Martlet (&#8220;The Nest&#8221;), a few hosted by classes (&#8220;Gender 305: Gender and International Human Rights&#8221;) and some by student groups (&#8220;Pulse Zine&#8221; podcast from the Students of Colour Collective).</p>

</div>


<p>Off the air, CFUV hosts campus and community events and shares charts and music reviews in its Offbeat column in student newspaper <em>The Martlet</em> (whose offices are conveniently across the hall). The column is a nod to <a href="https://archive.org/details/offbeatmagazine?tab=collection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Offbeat Magazine</a>, a print publication produced by CFUV from 1986 to 2003. While glancing through a few issues from the 1980s, I was taken back to the early days of the station. The nostalgia was appropriate, as CFUV recently celebrated its 40th year on FM. Signage and decorations from the anniversary bash add a festive touch to the CFUV volunteer office. Near a cozy couch and a space-age turntable, a binder of vintage clippings brings the station&#8217;s history to life. Although CFUV&#8217;s recent anniversary celebrated 40 years on FM, student radio activities at University of Victoria (and its predecessor institutions) stretch back even further.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Radio at Victoria College in the 1940s and 1950s</h2>



<p>Back in 1949, an early radio group on campus, The University Radio Society, was presenting a program called &#8220;University Round Table&#8221; on Saturday nights, with dreams of eventually airing the show on downtown stations. By 1950, the Radio Club had met that goal and was planning for its first broadcast over CKDA, an AM station in Victoria. Its initial plans were for a program featuring music from the Glee and Jazz clubs and discussions about China, the Bible and psychology. The resulting broadcast on March 20, 1950 included music and an overview of the governance and history of Victoria College. The following week&#8217;s episode showcased music and a performance of a Dickens play. Student newspaper <em>The Martlet</em> reported that, &#8220;It is hoped that the programs will continue until the end of April with the main features being the spotlighting of the various College Clubs and student activities such as the Students’ Council, athletics, and publications.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Campus-Only Station CJVC Begins Cafeteria Broadcasts in 1955</h2>



<p>By 1955, the Radio Club of Victoria College was spinning records during lunchtime broadcasts that were piped in to the school cafeteria. Shows included &#8220;Make Believe Ballroom,&#8221; &#8220;Rendezvous with Records,&#8221; &#8220;Personalities in Sound,&#8221; &#8220;Foods Platter Parade,&#8221; and &#8220;The Progressive Hour.&#8221; Calling itself CJVC, &#8220;the Voice of College Radio,&#8221; this campus-only station launched on November 21, 1955. Utilizing a &#8220;amplifier system with direct wire to the cafeteria&#8221; the radio club hoped to eventually add speakers to other parts of campus, according to an entry the 1955-1956 <em>Tower</em> yearbook. By the following year, the station&#8217;s schedule had expanded to three hours of programming, five days a week. Shows included progressive jazz, classical, folk, news, weather, and more. Some of the records played at the station were on loan from a local music store. </p>

</div>


<p>During the 1957-1958 school year, &#8220;individual booth speakers&#8221; were installed in the cafeteria and shows were heard for four hours a day, six days a week. By 1958, CJVC&#8217;s schedule had grown to 27 hours a week, with news airing at 10am and 1pm. Between 1958 and 1960, additional speakers were added to a new part of the cafeteria, to the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s commons, and to the activity hut. The station also regularly hosted dances.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Radio Club Becomes a Society in 1961; Operates from Shack</h2>



<p>In September 1961, the club became a society within the Department of Publications and Publicity and was broadcasting on the Lansdowne campus via a closed circuit system that they had &#8220;extended to the cafeteria, the common rooms and the Services room on Argyle Street.&#8221; In addition to the campus broadcasts, Radio Victoria College also began hosting &#8220;Campus Showcase&#8221; every Sunday afternoon over local station CFAX. After the success of these broadcasts, the club was given the opportunity to control an entire day of programming over CFAX on January 19, 1962. During this time, the radio club operated out of a &#8220;8’x16’ shack down the garden path from the caf,&#8221; as described in a February 1963 piece in the <em>Martlet</em>, which added that, &#8220;In their confined area they have managed to crowd a broadcasting room, one studio, and a very narrow alcove which doubles as a studio.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">U.V. Radio Scores Seven-Room Space in New SUB in 1963</h2>



<p>Considering the modest size of its original space, the radio station experienced a major upgrade later in 1963, when it moved operations to a custom-built headquarters in the basement of the new Student Union Building (SUB) on the Gordon Head campus. The station broadcast &#8220;music, campus news and occasional live events to the SUB lounge, and through telephone lines to the Lansdowne caf and commons,&#8221; wrote the <em>Martlet</em> on September 18, 1963. Now calling itself U.V. Radio, the campus radio station had seven rooms to itself, including three studios, a record library, office, entrance hall, and broom closet. It also began hosting the Playboy Bunny Bash, a semi-formal dance, which became an annual event. The 1964 dance featured live music from the Blue Tones, free cigarettes and bunnies &#8220;supplied by University and the Colony Motor Hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few years later, the station had to move again &#8212; this time to the old health services building while the SUB basement was remodeled. Despite the disruption, UVic Radio expanded its broadcasts to 70 hours a week by the 1966-1967 school year. During fall 1967, it dug into the &#8220;medical shack&#8221; crawl space in order to carve out another studio and by fall 1968 the station was on the air for 16 hours a day, with transmissions to the SUB and to 180 rooms in the dorms. Interestingly, these broadcasts could not be heard on the radio, but instead were still piped in to individual speakers that had volume control, but that could not be turned off completely. This led to debates over the years about the type of music being broadcast, especially since the station had a &#8220;captive&#8221; audience.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">UVic Radio aka CKVC Dies in 1970</h2>



<p>Despite its accomplishments, the station (which was using call letters CKVC in the late 1960s and early 1970s) began facing numerous challenges and ceased broadcasts in March 1970. The final blow came in October 1970 after a major theft of station equipment. Other clubs began using its space in the shack and there were attempts to resurrect the station beginning in 1973. By this point, the hut housing the old station was slated to be demolished. In a weird twist, approval was received for a radio license but there was no available space and minimal student interest despite additional meetings in 1975. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Radio Returns with Campus-Only Broadcasts in 1983, followed by CFUV-FM in 1985</h2>



<p>It was another few years before a group of students made an even more concerted effort to bring radio to campus, this time focusing on the ultimate goal of launching an FM station. A new radio club was formed and began closed circuit broadcasts by April 1983 using call letters CKLR. The call letters were changed to CFUV by September 1983 and after receiving an FM license, CFUV-FM launched in 1985. At this point CFUV had access to the entire 2nd floor of the SUB. A decade later, in 1996, it moved to a new studio in the lower SUB, where it remains today.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CFUV-FM Continues to Thrive in 2025</h2>



<p>With all the ups and downs faced by the various iterations of campus radio at University of Victoria, the past 40 years represent a period of amazing growth and stability for the more public-facing CFUV-FM. Certificates from the <a href="https://ncra.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Campus and Community Radio Association</a> commending various music shows as well as &#8220;Excellence in Student Programming&#8221; dot the station&#8217;s walls. The music industry has also taken note of CFUV&#8217;s support. As we chatted in his office, CFUV Station Manager Rowan Grice pointed to a 1994 gift from the Beastie Boys. Three golf balls emblazoned with the band member faces sit under a triangular plastic dome. &#8220;To CFUV-Radio. Thanks for Teeing Up The Beastie Boys October, 1994&#8221; reads a small plaque inside.</p>

</div>


<p>As I wrapped up my visit, Grice talked about his appreciation for the broader world of community radio, with the club-like feel and energy of stations like NTS attracting the attention of global listeners. In a strange way, the allure of these high profile stations can provide a gateway to local campus and community stations like CFUV. With that in mind, Grice said that he tries to incorporate the inspiring qualities of their online radio peers into the culture of CFUV. Much of that lies with the music, with Grice adding, &#8220;I&#8217;m always here for music discovery.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that the home of one of the oldest still-operating college radio stations, <a href="http://www.wesufm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WESU 88.1 FM</a> at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, is full of typical student radio artifacts. The walls are plastered with band stickers, posters and flyers. And most rooms contain shelves of CDs, vinyl records and cassettes. In fact, there&#8217;s so much physical music that the collection spills over into boxes and bins stashed here and there.</p>

<p>On the first day of October, General Manager Ben Michael greeted me in front of the station building and we ascended the stairs together to see the storied WESU space. With around 100 volunteers, the station includes both students and members of the Middletown community. Currently that works out to about a 60/40 split, but student interest in surging. The week before my visit, 140 students came by the WESU table at an activities fair to sign up for training.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Programming Mix at WESU</h2>



<p>A bit different from many student-focused stations, WESU airs syndicated programming (mostly from NPR, Pacifica and the BBC) for about half of the broadcast day. Locally-produced music and talk shows hosted by students and community members run during the remaining hours, from around 4pm to 4am. The afternoon and late night mix includes a range of music including jazz, big band, reggae, hardcore, emo, metal, ambient, underground house, electronic music from southern Africa, Black and queer club music, punk, and more. This broad array of programming is meant to support WESU&#8217;s goal to broadcast music and ideas that can&#8217;t easily be found on the radio dial. That philosophy also applies to some of the syndicated programming at WESU, including shows that play punk and hardcore (&#8220;Maximum Rock and Roll Radio&#8221;) and radio art (&#8220;The Radio Art Hour&#8221;).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WESU&#8217;s Beginnings as Carrier Current Station WES in 1939</h2>



<p>Founded at Wesleyan in 1939, WES was one of the first student-run carrier current radio stations in the United States. Known as the Cardinal Network of the Wesleyan Broadcasting System, the campus-only station was inspired by similar efforts at Brown University a few years earlier. Founding Technical Director Arch Doty (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/wesufm/arch-doty-1939?in=wesufm/sets/welcome-back" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hear his interview with WESU GM Ben Michael</a>) built his first radio receiver in 1932 and brought a homemade transmitter with him when he arrived on the Wesleyan campus in the fall of 1939. Officially launching as WES on November 9, 1939, the station operated out of Clark Hall.</p>

<p>By the 1948-1949 school year, WES was broadcasting six hours a day, with &#8220;recorded music, live shows &#8212; Jibers, drama and special events &#8212; and the best sports coverage in the history of the station,&#8221; according to the WES entry in the 1949 Wesleyan yearbook, <em>Olla Podrida</em>. Programming included &#8220;Jazz at its Best,&#8221; &#8220;Jive at Five,&#8221; campus news, a classical music hour, a show dedicated to war veterans, and rebroadcasts from FM station WDRC. In 1950, WES changed its call letters to WESU.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WESU Launches over FM in 1961</h2>



<p>In 1961, WESU launched FM broadcasts over 88.1 FM, thanks to its newly granted 10 watt FM license. By the late 1960s, the station was able to expand coverage even further with a power increase to 1000 watts. WESU continued to operate its AM station during this time.</p>

<p>Until the year 2001, WES and its descendant FM station WESU were headquartered on the Wesleyan campus in the basement of Clark Hall. Today, the station is located several blocks away in a residential part of town on the second floor of a building that also houses student newspaper, <em>The Wesleyan Argus</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Station Move and Addition of NPR Programming in Early 2000s</h2>



<p>The WESU move in 2001 was abrupt and disruptive, with General Manager Ben Michael recounting to me that historic papers and equipment were lost in the process. A few years later, the ownership of the station shifted from an independent student corporation to the school, with the WESU license now held by Wesleyan University. Michael is the one full-time staff member and works alongside a part-time program manager as well as the station&#8217;s board of directors (which is mostly comprised of students) and student and community leaders. Students play a major role at WESU and currently recruit and train staff, facilitate board and staff meetings, manage PR, run events, and more. Michael was brought on as a staff member (he&#8217;d been a long-time volunteer prior to that) in 2005, around the same time that WESU began airing NPR programming.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<p>Michael explained that the mid to late 1990s was a challenging time at WESU, with declining student interest in radio. Wesleyan University&#8217;s then-president Douglas Bennet, who had previously been President and CEO of NPR, led the charge for WESU to air NPR programming. Michael recounted, &#8220;When the university decided to bring NPR on board it was in part a response to the fact that the station was not being utilized during the day, every day.&#8221; He told me that the plan to add public radio programming led to &#8220;a major response and resistance on and off campus&#8221; and an &#8220;outcry&#8221; over the proposed changes to the station. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Community and Student Programs Continue at WESU</h2>



<p>In particular, long-time community-hosted shows were to have been eliminated. In the end, some of those shows shifted to other time slots and remain on the air today in large part because students spoke out. Michael relayed that, &#8220;The students really had the back of the community volunteers because they realize this is essential services to under-served populations.&#8221; In order to retain all of the student and community-run shows, WESU opted to shorten the length of some programs and shifted the schedule so that some were on the air on alternating weeks.</p>

</div>


<p>WESU&#8217;s ongoing commitment to the local community is also reflected by some of its talk programming, including &#8220;Engage Radio,&#8221; a university-backed show that &#8220;highlights civic engagement initiatives at Wesleyan University&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wesleyan.edu/allbritton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Allbritton Center</a>.&#8221; Michael said that the goal of the show is to &#8220;spotlight individuals and organizations that bridge the town and gown divide.&#8221; A recent episode focused on hip hop history and others have highlighted projects by the Middletown Historical Society. Another public affairs show, &#8220;River Valley Rhythms,&#8221; features interviews with local artists and regional arts promoters.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Honoring the WESU Archives</h2>



<p>Having grown up in Middletown, Michael has a deep appreciation for the the history of WESU and its ongoing legacy. He regaled me with stories about archival audio finds and projects to bring the station&#8217;s history to life. After locating recordings from the 1980s show, &#8220;The Living Edge,&#8221; one of its co-producers crafted handmade cassettes earlier this year as a premium for WESU&#8217;s fundraiser. The cassette compilation includes cover songs performed by Wesleyan bands circa 1986 to 1989. Although a tape might seem like an unusual thing for a 2025 fundraiser gift, it makes sense for a college radio station that reveres physical music. WESU is one of the few stations that I&#8217;ve visited recently that had a collection of organized cassettes in its on-air studio.</p>

<p>Michael loves radio and the experience of music discovery through the stacks, telling me, &#8220;We’re all fed by these algorithms and just introducing somebody to the library and the idea of reading liner notes and using them as a cross-reference to guide you on this scavenger hunt…That’s my own experience with music here at WESU and I try and introduce students and community members to that and get them outside of the bubble a little bit.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How a Community Radio Station Ended up in a Public Library</h2>



<p>A serendipitous series of events and conversations led to KYRS&#8217; move to the library in 2022. The station was outgrowing its space on the top floor of an old hotel building and Program Director Dana Matthews felt like the station was &#8220;invisible&#8221; to its listening audience. Longtime KYRS volunteer Jason Johnson is the library&#8217;s Community Engagement Manager and suggested that the station should move there after a library remodel. During a panel discussion at GRC, he explained that the library had become more focused on the arts in recent years. Its mission has much in common with the mission of KYRS, which strives to fill &#8220;needs that other media do not, providing programming to diverse communities and unserved or underserved groups.&#8221; </p>

<p>Johnson noted that having KYRS onsite allows the library to &#8220;have a bigger reach into the community.&#8221; In turn, KYRS is able to attract new volunteers, programmers and listeners due to its central location in a public space. Additionally, both organizations have benefited from a variety of broadcasts from the library, including a candidate forum and town hall hosted by the Spokane NAACP.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Touring KYRS during the Grassroots Radio Conference</h2>



<p>Located on the library&#8217;s third floor in a beautifully remodeled space, 20+ year old community radio station KYRS overlooks an open common area where events, including loud concerts, are held. With a studio and two small offices, the station also has access to a podcast studio and a production studio that are run by the library.</p>

<p>At appointed times during the GRC, KYRS opened its doors to conference attendees to allow them to poke around and see the inner workings of the community radio station. As a small cluster of us wandered into the studio one morning, Matthews greeted us and answered questions about the station. Although there wasn&#8217;t a live show from the studio, he was carefully monitoring audio coming in from a conference session, a live edition of the Pacifica show Sprouts, which was being broadcast live on air. </p>

<p>KYRS Engineer Dale Sanderson built the KYRS studio that were were touring and noted that it was his third station build. With a background in audio, he pointed out vacuum tube pre-amps that he installed in turntables and microphones at KYRS. In addition to turntables, the studio is outfitted with CD players and tape decks, allowing DJs to play from physical media. The walls are decorated with posters for various KYRS shows, letters from listeners, promotional T-shirts, and a vinyl record covered with handwritten birthday messages for Matthews.</p>

<p>The compact station space has some whimsical details, including cabinets with unusual printed labels that read &#8220;incurable disease specimens,&#8221; &#8220;secret plans for world domination,&#8221; and &#8220;enriched plutonium and light snacks.&#8221; Nearby a black rolling library cart sits near the wall, perhaps waiting to be filled with items to be returned to the stacks.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thin Air Community Radio&#8217;s Roots Date Back to 1999</h2>



<p>Founded in 1999, Thin Air Community Radio is a non-profit organization that runs community radio station KYRS 92.3 and 88.1 FM in Spokane, Washington. Beginning in 2000, Thin Air began operating as a project of the non-profit Citizens for Clean Air and applied for a low power FM (LPFM) license. After being awarded a construction permit, KYRS-LP (for &#8220;your radio station&#8221;) launched as an LPFM in October 2003. Four years later, in 2007, Thin Air Community Radio became an independent non-profit. By November 2011, the station upgraded to full power license (KYRS-FM) and now broadcasts at 6800 watts. KYRS moved to its current space in the Spokane Library in 2022 and their office moved to the library the following year.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Documenting the Station&#8217;s History</h2>



<p>During the 2025 Grassroots Radio Conference, KYRS Office Manager Lynnea Kaylor opened a session about KYRS with a timeline of the station&#8217;s history. She also provided details about her project to preserve the &#8220;treasure trove of an archive&#8221; that she found in the station&#8217;s former office. And while outlining the story of KYRS, she shared images from the archives and described the variety of projects that the station has undertaken, including film festivals, concerts, and music events at the library. After the KYRS session, attendees were invited to take a look at a display of Thin Air Community radio materials, including early newsletters, flyers, posters, program guides, and a binders full of clippings, listener correspondence and photos.</p>

</div>


<p>The collected items paint a picture of the breadth of programming and activities undertaken by KYRS. The station&#8217;s on-air schedule includes a mix of music, talk, public affairs and both locally-produced and syndicated programming. During a panel discussion at the conference featuring KYRS personnel, Station Manager Michael Moon Bear said that the station also trains programmers in all aspects of audio production. Matthews added that this has led to job opportunities for some volunteers, noting that KYRS can be a &#8220;ticket to a free technical education course.&#8221;</p>

<p>Around lunchtime on a warm day in September, <a href="https://wybc.com/home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WYBC</a> General Manager Jules Morris and I comb through stacks of paperwork from the Yale University radio station&#8217;s files. Car horns, traffic noises, and the sound of church bells seep through the windows of the office space on the second floor of a nearly 100-year-old apartment building facing busy Broadway Street in New Haven, Connecticut. Behind us, a wood-paneled wall serves as a backdrop for an assortment of framed photos, awards and plaques from the mid-20th century. While perched on a weathered cream colored couch, we flip through 70-year-old letters that were sent to WYBC from an all-star selection of luminaries from the time. In 1955, WYBC teamed up with the <em>Yale Daily News</em> to produce a series of broadcast forums. Based on the collection of letters received, the station aimed far and wide in an attempt to attract renowned and interesting speakers to campus.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WYBC Begins in 1941 as Carrier Current Station WOCD</h2>



<p>While marveling over the correspondence from politicians, scholars, authors, poets and religious leaders; we were transported back to the campus-only days of WYBC. Launched as WOCD (for &#8220;Oldest College Daily&#8221;) in 1941, the AM carrier current station began as a project of the <em>Yale Daily News</em> and had offices in the newspaper&#8217;s building. Early programming included a quiz show, radio drama, round table discussions, remote broadcasts and sports play-by-play. Originally on 905 AM, WOCD moved to 640 AM by the 1942-1943 academic year and the station remained on that spot on the dial for decades.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Call Letters Change to WYBC in Mid-1940s</h2>



<p>During the 1944-1945 academic year, WOCD split from the <em>Yale Daily News</em> and by 1946 had changed its call letters to WYBC (for &#8220;Yale Broadcasting Company&#8221;). The following year, WYBC helped to form the Ivy Network, which brought together college radio stations in order to collaborate and facilitate the sale of advertising spots. In 1948, Yale Broadcasting Company incorporated in the state of Connecticut as a non-profit organization.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Addition of WYBC-FM in 1959</h2>



<p>Over the years, WYBC has worked to expand its reach through a variety of methods. A second carrier current station (WYBC-A) was added in the mid-1950s and continued until 1968. In 1959, WYBC launched another station, <a href="https://www.943wybc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WYBC 94.3 FM</a> in New Haven. A commercially licensed station, WYBC-FM allowed students to broadcast off campus for the first time. The AM carrier current station continued until at least the mid-1980s and was eventually used in part as a training station for WYBC-FM.</p>

<p>By 1985, WYBC-FM was struggling financially, had equipment problems, and was also grappling with questions about its role on campus and in the broader community. At the time, students and non-students were on the air and also had roles in managing the station. Controversial programming and administrative changes were made, removing some community-hosted shows from the schedule. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WYBC 1340 AM Debuts in 1998</h2>



<p>However, in the ensuing years, fewer and fewer student DJs had shows over WYBC-FM, as the format shifted to urban contemporary hits radio. To address this, in 1998, WYBC purchased the license for the former WNHC-AM 1340, changing the call letters to WYBC. A piece in the <em>Yale Daily News</em> (September 15, 1998) reported that, &#8220;With more diverse music, greater freedom, and a home for student DJs, officials said the new AM frequency will complement the more professional sounding WYBC-FM.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Student-focused WYBCx is Born, While WYBC 1340 AM shifts to Public Radio Programming</h2>



<p>By the early 2000s, most student shows were hosted on WYBC 1340 AM, while the FM station was more outwardly focused to the local community. However, things shifted for the AM station as well, with it entering a time brokerage agreement with WSHU public radio in 2011. A few years prior, students began work on internet-only station WYBCx, which became the new student radio entity for WYBC.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WYBC Stations in 2025</h2>



<p>Today, Yale Broadcasting Company owns and oversees WYBC-AM, WYBC-FM and WYBCx. The FM station is professionally-run and the AM station airs the WSHU lineup of NPR and other public radio content. Additionally, a Yale undergraduate student has a journalism-focused paid internship at WYBC-AM. Both terrestrial stations operate under lease agreements, which provides income to Yale Broadcasting Company.</p>

<p>While WYBC General Manager Jules Morris is technically in charge of all of the stations, she doesn&#8217;t run the day-to-day operations of the AM and FM signals. For big picture decision-making, she works in collaboration with the Yale Broadcasting Company&#8217;s Board of Governors (made up of alumni and community members), which helps with financial oversight and also helps to provide institutional memory for the stations. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Touring WYBCx</h2>



<p>Morris&#8217; home base is in the Yale Broadcasting Company-owned building that houses the offices and studios for student station WYBCx across three floors of a former apartment building. A restaurant is located on the ground floor and rent from that business is another source of income for Yale Broadcasting Company.</p>

<p>A Yale University junior, Morris joined WYBC her freshman year and became Program Director last year before taking on the General Manager role this semester. &#8220;I knew I wanted to do college radio,&#8221; she said, adding that, &#8220;I knew it was really important culturally or it had been really important culturally.&#8221; Her interest in college radio began during her childhood in New York, when she tuned in to the Barnard College station. She recalled, &#8220;I would listen to WBAR all the time when I was a kid just because&#8230;my parents had students who had shows or I would want to find new music.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Variety of Programming and Projects at WYBCx</h2>



<p>Morris said that WYBCx is currently in a &#8220;transitional&#8221; period and that luckily there is a &#8220;big group of people&#8221; who are really committed to the station. Leadership positions include chairs of various departments, including broadcast, zine, podcast, design, events, board engineering, sound engineering, &#8220;Teen Takeover,&#8221; and sports. It&#8217;s a pretty amazing mix of activities for the station, which ranges from a high school after school program to live sports broadcasts to a printed music magazine (at times called Relatively Dark Blue Neither Purple Nor Green) to the concert and interview series &#8220;The Moon,&#8221; which was inspired by Tiny Desk Concerts.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Physical Music and Artifacts at WYBCx</h2>



<p>WYBC artifacts are tucked into various nooks and crannies on the three upper floors of the station&#8217;s 4-story building. CDs are stashed in kitchen cabinets and closets contain zine archives, posters, program schedules and other station ephemera. Vintage vinyl is here and there, including recordings of biblical readings, FDR speeches, classical records, and random 7&#8243;s. Awards throughout the space range from a 1997 award from music industry publication The Gavin Report to a 1950s certificate granting an &#8220;honorable mention&#8221; for the WYBC-produced documentary &#8220;This is College Radio.&#8221;</p>

<p>A skeleton poking out of a plastic bin is one of the many items brought over from the old &#8220;radio house,&#8221; where WYBC members lived for many years. A 10-minute walk from WYBCx, the rental was not only a place for radio folks to live, but its basement was also used for house shows. Morris said that sadly, &#8220;this last year nobody wanted to live there, so we lost it.&#8221; Subsequently, they had to clear out the basement, which was full of audio equipment and other accumulated items from the past 10 to 15 years.</p>

<p>Excited about the chance to play CDs over the radio, Morris told me that she is trying to get &#8220;the broadcast heads to organize a show that&#8217;s people going through the CDs that have been sent&#8221; in by bands and promoters. She imagined a program in which DJs would pop in a random release just to check it out. As we glanced around the CDs in that space, I spotted a punk rock tribute to the 1980s, a Mr. T Experience release, and a Chumbawamba CD in the kitchen.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cheery Top-Floor Studio at WYBCx</h2>



<p>After trekking up another flight of stairs, one arrives in the WYBCx studio. Under a sloped roof sits a desk with a cluster of chairs, mixing board, computer, DJ mixer, microphones, headphones and speakers. String lights hang on an adjacent wall and the opposite wall is full of posters. While sitting in the broadcast space, one faces a large open area that is set up for performances. Bright orange walls, carpet, and ceiling brighten that section; which is outfitted with a drum set, keyboard, microphones, monitor speakers and music stands.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<p>As Morris and I entered the studio, we heard loud hip hop music playing from the speakers. It was between regular shows and she explained that an automated playlist of music was being broadcast until the next DJ&#8217;s shift. As we looked out over the colorful space in front of us, Morris told me that this is where they record live music sets. However, live music isn&#8217;t confined to the WYBC space. In the couple of months since my visit, WYBCx has hosted several shows and a &#8220;pop-up rave&#8221; in various locations around New Haven.</p>

<p>While wrapping up my tour, Morris expressed both her excitement about the future of WYBC and also her appreciation for the station&#8217;s legacy. She said, &#8220;I want this to be a big year&#8230;and archives are such a big part of that.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thanks to WYBCx + Archives of Station Tours</h2>



<p>Thanks to Jules Morris for the tour of the WYBCx space and for sharing some fascinating historical materials with me during my visit. I&#8217;ve been building a <a href="https://archive.org/details/wybc-radio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WYBC collection</a> in the <a href="https://archive.org/details/collegeradio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">College Radio collection</a> within the <a href="https://archive.org/details/dlarc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Library of Amateur Radio and Communications</a> (DLARC) on the Internet Archive, so it was amazing for me to finally see the Yale radio operation in person. Additionally, since I&#8217;ve done research within the Yale University archives over the years, the visit helped to bring that research to life. To learn more about the early 1950s at WYBC and community radio pioneer Lorenzo Milam&#8217;s time at the station, see my piece, <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2020/08/lorenzo-milams-college-radio-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lorenzo Milam&#8217;s College Radio Days</a>. This is my 188th radio station tour report and my 130th college radio station tour. You can view the entire collection of my radio station visits in <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/radio-station-tours-in-numerical-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerical order</a> or <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/radio-station-tours/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by station type</a> in our archives.</p>

<p>Perched on a shelf in the <a href="https://sites.williams.edu/wcfm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WCFM 91.9 FM</a> studio at Williams College sit well-loved copies of <em>Moby Dick</em>, <em>Ulysses</em>, and <em>The Idiot</em>. Band stickers are plastered on an entry door, records and CDs are spread throughout the room, and an overhead pipe rumbles &#8212; a reminder of the college radio station&#8217;s dorm basement digs. While many of the sights and sounds in this studio are common in student radio spaces; Herman Melville, James Joyce and Fyodor Dostoevsky tomes aren&#8217;t usually on my mental bingo card during college radio station tours.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Doing Radio at a &#8220;College of Nerds&#8221;</h2>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really a college of nerds,&#8221; mused WCFM General Manager Olivia Johnson as we chatted in the station in Williamstown, Massachusetts on a chilly morning in early October. She joked, &#8220;We love doing our homework. It&#8217;s our biggest passion. And then after that, it&#8217;s <em>talking</em> about doing our homework and then talking about our homework. It&#8217;s pretty much those three.&#8221; Johnson explained that the collection of novels are left over from recent on-air readathons. During these 24-hour broadcasts, station members take turns reading aloud from the chosen book of the year. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCFM-studio-IMG_1344.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCFM-studio-IMG_1344-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-52308" srcset="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCFM-studio-IMG_1344-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCFM-studio-IMG_1344-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCFM-studio-IMG_1344-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCFM-studio-IMG_1344.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>WCFM on-air studio.

</div>


<p>The most recent readathon was in December 2024, when WCFM brought <em>The Idiot</em> to the airwaves. Johnson described the experience, telling me, &#8220;That&#8217;s when the station really is at its creepiest, when you come in for your&#8230;4am slot and nobody&#8217;s here and you&#8217;re&#8230;reading Dostoevsky alone to yourself.&#8221; She said that <em>Ulysses</em> was her favorite and added that the guy who picked <em>Moby Dick</em> ended up writing his thesis, in part, about the book. &#8220;So it really made an impact,&#8221; she pointed out.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Connecting with Student Community through Radio</h2>



<p>A senior history major, Johnson was first introduced to WCFM her freshman year when she regularly tagged along during a friend&#8217;s show. She eventually went through training herself and took on a variety of roles at the station. For her, listening to the campus radio station was a way to get to know other Williams students freshman year, during a time when she was looking to find community. &#8220;[It was] really amazing to turn on my radio and hear my friends voices and hear the shows of people who I didn&#8217;t know personally but who I&#8217;d seen around campus,&#8221; she recalled, adding, &#8220;It gave me this sort of personal window into the people who I saw every day.&#8221; Listening also caused her to feel connected to the &#8220;random&#8221; DJs behind the mic. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCFM-mini-zine-IMG_1423.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCFM-mini-zine-IMG_1423-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-52297" srcset="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCFM-mini-zine-IMG_1423-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCFM-mini-zine-IMG_1423-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCFM-mini-zine-IMG_1423-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCFM-mini-zine-IMG_1423.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>WCFM promotional mini zine on the wall of the college radio station.

</div>


<p>Since WCFM is a freeform station, it allows DJs and hosts to curate shows reflecting their own unique interests and tastes. For Johnson, that is an increasingly important aspect of college radio. &#8220;Especially today, especially in a time of&#8230;algorithms controlling so much of our content consumption, there&#8217;s something really valuable and important about creating&#8230;a playlist&#8230;for another person, which is actually a big sea of people who are faceless to you,&#8221; she explained. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Williams College Radio History: WMS Debuts in 1940</h2>



<p>Student radio at Williams dates back to the 1930s, when amateur radio enthusiasts sent broadcasts from their dorm rooms. In 1940, AM carrier current station WMS was launched by students and in 1957 it expanded beyond campus through the addition of a low power class D FM channel at 90.1 FM with call letters WCFM. By the early 1970s, WCFM had increased its wattage to 444 watts and after a series of moves on the dial, shifted to its current frequency of 91.9 FM. </p>

<p>Old photos from WCFM&#8217;s past are on display on its <a href="https://laurenkhall.nekoweb.org/website/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly-designed website</a>, which embraces a vintage computer interface aesthetic, complete with animated gifs. A more elaborate WCFM history collage is on the wall of the broadcast studio, including print-outs of black and white photos of the station and DJs from decades past. Johnson noted that former WCFM General Manager Josh Picoult had collected the photos, which went up before a 2024 &#8220;throwback weekend&#8221; at the station. Picoult (class of 2024) wrote his senior thesis, &#8220;<a href="https://archive.org/details/gas-pipes-gigahertz-and-grunge-picoult-joshua-thesis-2024/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gas Pipes, Gigahertz, and Grunge: Broadcasting at Williams College, 1940-1998</a>,&#8221; about the station&#8217;s pre-streaming era. That same semester, he joined us on the Radio Survivor show to discuss that work (<a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2024/04/podcast-340-college-radio-history-at-williams-college/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">listen to podcast #340</a> for even more back story).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WCFM&#8217;s Variety of Freeform Programming </h2>



<p>Housed in the basement of a freshman dorm (Prospect House), WCFM has hour-long live shows typically between 8am and 2am, with studio access unavailable (except for during the readathons) between 2am and 6am. At the time of my visit, there were around 130 DJs involved with WCFM and perhaps 20 hours of the weekly schedule were waiting to be filled by newly trained on-air hosts. In the interim, those slots were covered ad hoc by various DJs, included those extending their shows before and after the open hour. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<p>Johnson described the range of programming on WCFM, including &#8220;chatty&#8221; talk shows amongst friends that tend to play 2000s pop and alternative 1990s music (including off of CDs), programs reflecting the taste of &#8220;a large folk contingent&#8221; of DJs, and a show run by the Williams College electronic music club in which they play their mixes. The station is also experimenting with four focused hours of specialty programming each week: Open Hour, Study Hall, Noisy Hour, and Anything But English. DJs are invited to pitch their ideas for one-hour shows along these themes each week. The categories were kept purposefully broad to spark open interpretation. Recent shows have dug into new releases and Russian rap and a future show was expected to feature Bulgarian folk.</p>

</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Physical Music at WCFM</h2>



<p>DJs at WCFM have an enviably large library of physical music to draw from. The main library is across the hall from the on-air booth, so WCFM keeps some of the most-played records and CDs close at hand in the studio. When I visited, some favorites (chosen by DJs, music directors and stacks librarians) were housed in wooden cubbies as well as on countertops. Releases from Pere Ubu, Ween, The Strokes, Vashti Bunyan, Live Skull, Elliott Smith, Boy Girl Party, and Flaming Lips were among the stacks and piles of currently-used records and CDs in the studio.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCFM-cubbies-IMG_6767.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCFM-cubbies-IMG_6767-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-52306" srcset="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCFM-cubbies-IMG_6767-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCFM-cubbies-IMG_6767-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCFM-cubbies-IMG_6767-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCFM-cubbies-IMG_6767.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Cubbies containing favorite CDs and records in WCFM broadcast studio.

</div>


<p>The majority of the music stacks are in a designated CD room and in a multi-room music office, where ongoing reorganization efforts are in progress. Johnson purposefully brings freshmen into the music office during their first few months of training. During meetings they pick out music to play and talk about. She explained that through this process, it &#8220;sort of sets a precedent,&#8221; so that new DJs will play vinyl. She described one freshman DJ who would lug stacks of records from the library into the studio for his show each week, noting that he&#8217;s now on the station&#8217;s board. Johnson speculated that maybe a third of the DJs use records at least some of the time, acknowledging that more people use CDs because &#8220;they are more familiar with the technology.&#8221;</p>

</div>


<p>As we toured through the record collection, Johnson pointed out the written reviews on many of the older records, telling me that WCFM staffers used to more consistently write comments and funny notes on album covers, which she enjoys finding in the library. The collection of music is wide-ranging, including 1960s pop, Paul Williams, Public Enemy, Frank Zappa, Dandy Warhols, Meices, and more. Stashed in U.S. mail bins and within rolling library-style shelves are many hidden gems.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WCFM Off-Air Activities, from Concerts to Publications</h2>



<p>Off-the air, WCFM hosts concert series, including a semesterly Cov Ball (formerly known as Covercella) during which bands play cover tunes. The station has also produced a number of publications in recent years, including zines, newsletters, and even a mini comic describing WCFM&#8217;s illustrious history.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Many of these paper artifacts are on display on the walls of WCFM, including a poster-sized summer newsletter. As we chatted in the hallway before she had to head off to class, Johnson talked about the meaning behind these creations. &#8220;We really like having something tangible,&#8221; she said. Acknowledging the ephemeral nature of radio, she mused, &#8220;We don&#8217;t record all of our shows, so a lot of what you do is just gone after you do it&#8230;This is kind of the counterpoint to that&#8230;having all this physical stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>On October 3, 2025, while World College Radio Day was being celebrated all over the globe, Cleveland State University&#8217;s nearly 50-year old student-run college radio station WCSB 89.3 FM was shut down by administrators.&nbsp;Staff and volunteers were escorted out of the station by police and programming was soon replaced by JazzNEO, a music service produced by public radio group Ideastream.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the ensuing weeks, WCSB participants and supporters have been protesting this move and have organized under the name XCSB.&nbsp;To discuss what happened to the Cleveland State college radio station and what lies ahead for XCSB, two former WCSB student leaders join us on Radio Survivor. Liam Main was the business manager of WCSB and Alison Bomgardner was the most recent General Manager of the station.</p>

<p>This year, College Radio Day began for me in the best possible way, with a visit to Middlebury College&#8217;s student-run radio station <a href="https://wrmc.middlebury.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WRMC 91.1 FM</a> in Middlebury, Vermont. From the second that I walked into the station, on the upper floor of the Proctor Dining Hall, I was charmed by the colorful space. Lavender and pink walls lead to a hallway containing a sweet mural painted in the style of &#8220;Goodnight Moon.&#8221; The artwork depicts a group of headphone-wearing dogs sitting at a poker table, while listening to a WRMC-logo&#8217;d radio. The personality-filled walls hinted at the treasures to come throughout my visit.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Touring WRMC on College Radio Day</h2>



<p>After settling into a cozy couch in the station&#8217;s lobby lounge on a Friday morning in October, I spoke with WRMC&#8217;s Co-General Managers Neel Shah and Matthew Held. Both seniors at Middlebury, Shah and Held met soon after arriving on campus as freshmen and quickly bonded over a shared love for music. They went to their first WRMC meeting that year and according to Held, &#8220;once we were both there for the first time, we were hooked.&#8221; Finding a &#8220;welcoming community&#8221; at the station, they both got very involved, later joining the board sophomore year as co-social chairs. Last year Shah served as co-Music Director.</p>

<p>Although many people discover their college radio stations after arriving on campus, Shah became enamored with WRMC during his senior year of high school. After he was accepted to Middlebury early decision, he noticed a link to the station on the college website and told me, &#8220;I knew this was something that I wanted to do.&#8221; He started tuning in to WRMC from his home in Hong Kong and explained that due to the time difference, he ended up listening to early morning and late night shows, which he could listen to in the middle of the day in Hong Kong. &#8220;So I got a very strange taste,&#8221; for the programming, he noted, because the shows during those hours are often hosted by newer DJs or are simply &#8220;weird late night programming.&#8221; </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Late Night Radio at WRMC</h2>



<p>One show, &#8220;Freaks and Geeks,&#8221; drew him in. The hosts spoke about historical figures, deeming them freaks or geeks before playing songs to coincide with the discussion. Shah thought their show was &#8220;the coolest thing in the whole world,&#8221; and decided that he &#8220;wanted to do something like this.&#8221; Since starting at WRMC, Shah has always hosted a late night show so that his parents can tune in live. &#8220;They love to listen, and I wouldn&#8217;t want them to be shut out,&#8221; he explained, adding that he also likes the freedom to play music with swear words, which is another advantage of late night time slots.</p>

</div>


<p>Although Held didn&#8217;t listen to WRMC prior to arriving on campus, he did know a bit about college radio through friends&#8217; &#8220;cool&#8221; older brothers who did college radio at University of Texas, Austin. His older brother went to a different college and had friends doing radio, so the concept of student radio was in Held&#8217;s mind before his freshman year. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Allure of College Radio</h2>



<p>At Middlebury&#8217;s station, both Shah and Held try to foster a welcoming place where everyone who&#8217;d like a show, can get on the air. Held said that doing radio is &#8220;an outlet for a lot of people&#8221; and a &#8220;a time that you can be totally alone&#8221; and not think about school work and other stressors, adding, &#8220;You can go in there&#8230;turn the speakers loud, play your music and really let it all out.&#8221; Shah also sees the therapeutic value of radio, saying that he loves going to the studio. He describes the studio as sort of a sacred space, telling me, &#8220;my one rule for myself is I never do my homework while doing my show.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mix of Programming at WRMC</h2>



<p>I visited during the first week on the air for all the new WRMC DJs and hosts. Daily training sessions had just wrapped up the day before and were mandatory for everyone at the station because of a new website. Since the on-air staff is made up of around 140 people, that made for a hectic time at WRMC, with folks in and out of the studio for training. The schedule contains about 100 shows, which are generally an hour in length. The vast majority of the programs are hosted by students, but there a few exceptions. Syndicated news program &#8220;Democracy Now&#8221; airs on weekdays,  and a few alumni are still on the air. Additionally, long-time DJ, &#8220;The Voodoo Man,&#8221; has been on WRMC for decades and currently does a blues/rock show on Saturday mornings.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<p>While touring through WRMC, I spotted a common college radio station sight: the mapping out of the broadcast schedule on an office wall using strips of paper on a cork board. For fall 2025, the array of shows is a fascinating mix. Shah shared a few highlights, including the whimsically-named &#8220;<a href="https://wrmc.middlebury.edu/evil-boyfriend-registry-pre-raphaelite-brotherhood-show" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evil boyfriend registry: The pre-raphaelite Brotherhood Show</a>.&#8221; He said that he&#8217;d been looking forward to tuning in to this new Sunday afternoon show in part because the hosts &#8220;make art history sound interesting.&#8221; He also mentioned that the schedule expands even further during the summer, when Middlebury College hosts a language immersion program. Students in that program sign a language pledge, promising to communicate only in the language that they are studying. For that reason, WRMC has ended up with summer DJs taking part in that program and that has resulted in shows in a variety of languages, including German, Arabic, and Chinese.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Digging into CD and Vinyl Collection at WRMC</h2>



<p>DJs can play music from a large collection of physical music at WRMC, but most of the student DJs use digital music during their shows. Shah noted that the record player is used &#8220;very occasionally,&#8221; adding that &#8220;the needle keeps breaking because people don’t know how to treat it.&#8221; This is despite required equipment training. Held explained that DJs planning to use vinyl are given a specific training and said that more people actually use vinyl than CDs. However the CD collection does have some allure, with Shah mentioning that a former station manager did an all-CD show, adding that, &#8220;I kind of what to do that this year.&#8221; CDs are stored all over the station, but the majority line the hallway and are housed in a huge set of glass-fronted cabinets that resemble built-ins that you might see in a vintage dining room. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">On-Air Studio is Full of Life</h2>



<p>The on-air studio feels full of life. A set of shelves are provided for WRMC staffers and each of them has a little section where they display little tchotchkes and CDs that express their personalities. It&#8217;s adjacent to a window with a view of campus, which makes for a lovely scene. Nearby is a list of the names of previous station executives, as a way for folks to leave their mark. When we arrived in the studio, it was between DJs, yet music from the station&#8217;s automation system (&#8220;a grab bag of new music&#8221; according to Shah) was blasting from the speakers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<p>A doorway from the studio leads to WRMC&#8217;s main recording studio, where musicians record live sessions for broadcast. Although the room had fallen out of use in the wake of COVID, the space has been revamped in the past few years. Additionally, student artists are able to record here. A band from Wesleyan University even requested to record there after seeing videos posted to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WRMC911/featured" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WRMC YouTube channel</a> of live recordings. The space is full of instruments and several walls also contain shelves of CDs and vinyl records. A small recording booth is linked to the recording studio.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WRMC History: 1940s Launch of Carrier Current Station WMCRS</h2>



<p>Rich in history, WRMC hosted a 75th anniversary of Middlebury radio event last year. The story goes that the first broadcast was out of a chicken coop in 1949. That station, known as WMCRS (Middlebury Campus Radio Service), was an AM carrier current station. In advance of its launch, a <a href="https://archive.org/details/middleburyNewspapers_1949-03-31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story in Middlebury Campus</a> described the set-up as transmitting over &#8220;dormitory bell circuits,&#8221; with WMCRS expected to reach all of the dorms. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Campus-Only AM Station Changes Call Letters to WRMC in 1952</h2>



<p>In 1950, the FCC alerted WMCRS that it was broadcasting beyond the allowed range and the station ceased operations for around six months, returning in April 1951. In 1952, <a href="https://archive.org/details/middleburyNewspapers_1952-10-09/page/n1/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Middlebury Campus reported</a> that the station changed its name to WRMC after receiving a letter from Intercollegiate Broadcasting System stating that &#8220;according to international agreements, five-letter call letters cannot be assigned.&#8221; The station was still campus-only carrier current broadcasting at 750 AM.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WRMC Awarded FM License and Moves to 91.7 FM in 1968</h2>



<p>By December 1967, WRMC had a construction permit to go FM. In the months leading up to this, the station expressed concerns about shifting to a non-commercial license, since as a carrier current station it was free to air advertising. The 10 watt class D station launched over 91.7 FM in early 1968 out of its existing studios in Proctor Hall. It began stereo broadcasts in 1978 and then in the early 1980s, WRMC upgraded its wattage to 100 watts. In 2000 the wattage increased again to 2900 watts and the station was also broadcasting online using RealAudio over a rebuilt website. At some point by the early 1990s, the spot on the dial shifted to 91.1 FM, where WRMC remains today.</p>

<p>With such a storied history, it&#8217;s not surprising that there are ghostly rumors surrounding WRMC&#8217;s space in Proctor Hall. Shah told me that a long-time DJ has told tales of flickering lights and CDs skipping on specific songs. Apparently these are messages from former DJs that &#8220;want to get on the air for one last time.&#8221; Held describes them as &#8220;benevolent ghosts.&#8221;</p>

<p>As I was plotting out my fall vacation to New England, I imagined chilly days, falling leaves and colorful foliage. While hot weather was the norm for much of the trip, the first bit of crispness was in the air for my twilight visit to <a href="https://www.benningtonradio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">B-Rad</a>, the student-run college radio station at Bennington College in Bennington, Vermont. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Autumn Tour of B-Rad</h2>



<p>On the first day of October, B-Rad co-manager Ellie Nowak and I exchanged hellos outside of the Elizabeth Coleman Center for the Advancement of Public Action (CAPA) building, steps away from the radio station. The sun was starting to set as we approached the golden hour. Not a soul was around and I was dazzled by the view of orange-leafed trees and lush green grass. Located on a former farm, the 440 acre campus is full of rural charm. </p>

</div>


<p>Nowak, a senior, is already feeling wistful about her &#8220;last Bennington fall.&#8221; She&#8217;s been involved with B-Rad since freshman year and continues to do a radio show in addition to her work as a station manager. She&#8217;s always had a Saturday night time slot and remarked that she likes having &#8220;a ritual like that.&#8221; Although the show has taken different forms over the years, she has always had at least one co-host who is also a childhood friend.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fall 2025 B-Rad Schedule was in the Works</h2>



<p>At the time of my visit, B-Rad was in the process of finalizing the fall schedule. Show applications had just been submitted and DJs were about to receive training. With a roster of around 50 participants, B-Rad was expected to have about 32 shows this semester. The station is managed by 3 student board members (Nowak and co-manager Myriel Byfield, plus tech manager Henry Altman) and B-Rad also has a faculty adviser. On such a small campus, with just under 800 students, it&#8217;s impressive to see this level of involvement.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<p>Although B-Rad participants are mostly students, B-Rad does have some programs run by community members, including one hosted by a family with elementary-school aged children. Nowak mentioned that a few campus organizations, including the Restorative Justice Collective, had applied for shows. Additionally, a group of international students hosts a program during which they &#8220;showcase different elements of their culture from their home country,&#8221; with weekly themes focusing on &#8220;folklore, festivals&#8230;films, music, literature&#8221; and more.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mix of Programming on B-Rad</h2>



<p>Nowak ran through the gamut of shows, including everything from genre-focused programs to radio plays to talk shows (including comedy, feminism, and politics-focused) to &#8220;D&amp;D and world building&#8221; shows. On music shows, DJs play a broad mix of genres, including folk, metal, goth, underground, outlaw country, grindcore, punk, and crankwave. A number of DJs do weekly theme-based shows. Participants have a lot of freedom to play and say what they&#8217;d like, especially since the station is online-only. Nowak said that the one rule is &#8220;don&#8217;t be evil on air and use common sense.&#8221; When there isn&#8217;t a live host, a mix of music and programming from the B-Rad archives is played through the station&#8217;s webstream.</p>

</div>


<p>While most B-Rad participants play digital music on their shows, they do have access to a CD player and the station&#8217;s collection of physical music. Some DJs do live mixing too. A cabinet is full of CDs, many of which were acquired during the station&#8217;s early days when they sent a call-out for CD donations in order to build their library. During Nowak&#8217;s freshman year there was a record player at B-Rad. She wasn&#8217;t sure what happened to it, but told me, &#8220;I love physical media&#8221; and &#8220;the nostalgia of it all.&#8221; She said that she wished that more DJs used the station&#8217;s CD player.</p>

<p>Launched as an online station on April 1, 2017, B-Rad remained active through the COVID shutdown, but became a bit more disconnected from campus life. &#8220;I really want to help pick that up again,&#8221; Nowak said. She told me that she has been working hard to get the word out about the station, adding that &#8220;It&#8217;s more fun when it&#8217;s a big community thing.&#8221; Although the station is in a beautiful building, Nowak noted that it&#8217;s in a low traffic area compared with other buildings. For that reason, people post flyers and posters for their shows all over campus. </p>

<p>B-Rad also had a table at Bennington&#8217;s Club Fair, at which they talked to students about the radio station. Nowak said that a few seniors came to the table and didn&#8217;t know much about the station or how to listen, which was a reminder to her about the work still to be done. As we chatted, she checked the station&#8217;s stream statistics showing that there were 3 listeners (numbers go up when there&#8217;s a live show that hosts are promoting). It was between live shows and she speculated that it could be bots from Germany, noting that sometimes they have bots or perhaps dedicated fans from Finland. It is hard for B-Rad to discern.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">B-Rad Launched in 2017</h2>



<p>Since its inception in 2017, B-Rad has been housed in a tiny room just off the lobby of the CAPA building. The office-like space has a desk, computer, and audio equipment. A wall is crammed full of drawings and messages that have accumulated over the past few years. Nowak pointed out that the name of her old show was still there and she didn&#8217;t have the heart to erase it. In addition to on-air programming, B-Rad has hosted various campus events, game nights and a poster-making party. Nowak also hopes to bring more campus artists to B-Rad listeners and noted that Bennington College has a lot of students who do live DJ mixing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1952 Launch of Campus Radio Station at Bennington College</h2>



<p>While Nowak wasn&#8217;t aware of other radio stations on campus prior to B-Rad, I was determined to learn if there were any student radio predecessors. As it turns out, Bennington College has been home to many different student-led radio stations over the years. In 1952, Augusta (&#8220;Gus&#8221;) Welfer Bartlett started an AM carrier current station as her senior project, back when Bennington was a women&#8217;s college. Bartlett had spent a winter working at a radio station in Atlanta and upon her return to campus she decided that &#8220;Bennington should have a radio station that would give its talented students a chance to be heard over the air and to have fun at the same time,&#8221; reported the <a href="https://crossettlibrary.dspacedirect.org/items/00cb8d8c-86a9-4566-b81f-38ab2d5f9742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Bennington Weekly</em> in December 1950</a>. She started work on the station in spring 1951 and began test broadcasts out of the recording room in Jennings Hall in May 1952.</p>

</div>


<p>I was amazed to learn that Bartlett launched the station just a month before her June 1952 graduation AND the expected birth of her child. In a <a href="https://crossettlibrary.dspacedirect.org/items/a65c9307-091f-4672-9051-d53f589bfe86" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">piece</a> for the <em>Bennington College Alumnae Quarterly</em> in 1952, Bartlett talks about what prompted her to start a college radio station. Unsatisfied with the nearby radio offerings, she explains, &#8220;&#8230;some gentlemen in Schenectady have been producing radio programs for some time, but they never seemed to creep across the state line into Vermont with very much vigor, nor were the programs always what the intellectual ladies craved. So I decided the time had come for the College to have its own station.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bartlett built a campus-only AM station, which could be heard within the confines of Bennington College. &#8220;Finally, after a year and a half of punching holes, mounting equipment and soldering countless bits of wire, The Thing was completed,&#8221; she writes. Spring semester 1952 was a test phase for the station, which opened up for participation from the entire campus the following fall.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WGBB Expands as Campus Activity in Fall 1952</h2>



<p>According to an <a href="https://crossettlibrary.dspacedirect.org/items/79f82640-e75e-44dd-94c5-375bbbe74ca2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> in the <em>Bennington Biweekly</em>, the campus station fully opened with a launch over 620 AM on November 5, 1952 under the call letters WGBB (named for founder &#8220;Gus&#8221; and her husband Bob Bartlett). Operated and managed by students, WGBB continued to receive occasional technical assistance from founder Gus Bartlett. The schedule that semester ran for about 3 hours nightly (except Saturdays) and included jazz, opera, light classical music, radio drama, a French disc jockey and dance music programs. &#8220;Pleasant taped seminars, workshops, faculty concerts&#8230;campus events&#8221; and &#8220;a full length opera&#8221; were in the works, in addition to collaborative programs (including dramas) with WMS at Williams College. A campus news show was to air announcements, including &#8220;a service for anyone wanting or offering rides for the weekend.&#8221;</p>

<p>By Spring 1953, WGBB had moved to 590 AM, was broadcasting from 7:30pm to 10:30pm, and was airing radio drama, a poetry and prose show, a panel show with faculty and students, seminar recordings, a dance music show, and more. The following fall, around 30 students were part of the staff of WGBB &#8220;the Voice of Bennington College.&#8221; By spring 1954, the radio station was using call letter WGBN, had become a trial member of the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS) and had started fundraising in order to move the station due to transmission issues. The move was completed by fall 1954, with WGBN relocating to the Barn from its home in Jennings. At the time, the station was once again enlisting the help of its founder to get its broadcasts operational. Sadly, by spring 1959, <a href="https://archive.org/details/Intercollegiate-Broadcasting-System-Newsletter-58-59-6-March-14-1959/page/10/mode/2up?q=bennington" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IBS reported</a> that WGBN had gone off the air and was dropped from its membership roster.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Students Launch WHIP-FM in 1990s</h2>



<p>In the years after the demise of WGBB/WGBN, there was a project called &#8220;Bennington College Radio Players&#8221; in the late 1980s, followed in the mid-1990s by the creation of the very low power WHIP-FM. Station Manager Wendy Lawrence wrote a profile of WHIP for the <a href="https://crossettlibrary.dspacedirect.org/items/5bdb0513-874d-443a-93ed-cc852dc81b48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">winter 1994 issue of Quadrille</a>, saying &#8220;WHIP 88.5 FM, Bennington&#8217;s own student broadcast, currently operates out of the third floor of Commons with a hand-built transmitter that hangs from a hockey stick. WHIP broadcasts at about one watt and reaches most of the dorms.&#8221;</p>

<p>WHIP&#8217;s broadcasts were designed to only reach the campus, so it operated without an FCC license. A weekly blurb that ran in Bennington&#8217;s <em>College Week</em> newsletter in 1994 notes that &#8220;it may be heard anywhere from 88.3 FM to 89.1 FM Monday through Sunday after 7 p.m. If you don&#8217;t get it in.

The author describes the space, writing, &#8220;Decorated with patches of what seems to be &#8217;90s grunge band glory, an oft-used couch falling apart in a corner and witty sharpie graffiti from students long gone, there exists a spirit of banter and intimacy in the room that is not often found on our crowded campus today.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t able to find further details about this phase of radio at Bennington, but flashing forward another 7 years or so, B-Rad made its online debut in 2017.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thanks to B-Rad + Station Tour Archive</h2>



<p>Thanks to Ellie Nowak for the tour of B-Rad and also thanks to Dean of the Crossett Library at Bennington College, Oceana Wilson, for research assistance. I cannot believe my luck, as Wilson had just recently digitized the 1950s student newspapers, which are a goldmine of information about early radio at Bennington College. This is my 185th radio station tour report and my 127th college radio station tour. You can view the entire collection of my radio station visits in <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/radio-station-tours-in-numerical-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerical order</a> or <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/radio-station-tours/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by station type</a> in our archives.</p>

<p>One of my favorite things about tuning in to terrestrial radio is hearing unlikely juxtapositions as stations fade in and out of each other. With religious radio covering much of the left side of the dial in some communities, there are often unintentionally bizarre mash-ups of faith-based messages with the sometimes edgier music and lyrics of college radio. As I drove towards Lewiston, Maine listening to 91.5 FM on a Monday afternoon in October, I was expecting to catch Bates College radio station <a href="https://wrbcradio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WRBC</a>, but instead heard a cheery tune about heaven and a &#8220;divine maker.&#8221; The last lyrics that I could discern were &#8220;God&#8217;s word endures forever,&#8221; before the music got choppy and then disappeared into silence.</p>

<p>Soon a DJ came on the microphone and said, &#8220;You Just heard &#8216;The Hairstyle of the Devil by Momus.'&#8221; The DJ took a call from a childhood friend, for which listeners could only catch one side of the conversation. But in my rental car, I was also hearing a nearby religious radio station (which showed up on the car&#8217;s audio dashboard display as &#8220;91.5 Jesus #1&#8221;) fading in and out in &#8220;call and response&#8221; style as the college radio DJ from WRBC told a story about the friend. After the DJ cued up a song from the Cocteau Twins, I was charmed by the full arc of the moment, as the music of one of my favorite bands emanating from the car speakers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Touring WRBC at Bates College</h2>



<p>Hearing that bit of unplanned radio art over WRBC piqued my curiosity as I headed towards the Bates College student-run radio station for a tour. A short time later, I entered <a href="https://wrbcradio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WRBC 91.5 FM</a>&#8216;s basement lair through the back entrance of an old house that had been converted to a campus building. I felt like I was descending into a secret clubhouse, full of music and memorabilia from the station&#8217;s 67-year history.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<p>I was greeted by Olivia Torrington (WRBC&#8217;s Community Liaison and Digital Media head) and WRBC co-General Managers Matt Riseman and Brett Karpf. We had a chat and tour before everyone headed to a station board meeting. As it was towards the start of the academic year, WRBC was in the midst of various organizational projects, including revamping and cleaning up the station and training new participants.</p>

</div>


<p>While wandering through the funky station space, it was impossible to ignore signs of WRBC&#8217;s storied past. A cozy lounge area is where I began my tour. Seated on what looked like a college-issued dorm couch, I had a view of a collection of colorful vintage chairs (some scored at yard sales), graffiti-covered walls, and a jam-packed physical music library full of CDs and records. </p>

<p>Past the record library is a hallway with another couch, a bathroom (The Pee Studio), office area, a former production studio, more storage space, and the on-air studio. Band and radio stickers are plastered on various surfaces and one wall is decorated with a collage of vintage clippings and photos representing the history of radio at Bates College.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Campus Radio Station WVBC Launches in 1951</h2>



<p>Debuting over FM in 1958, WRBC had its origins as 640 AM campus-only carrier current station WVBC (for &#8220;Voice of Bates College&#8221;), which launched in Chase Hall in 1951. From the very beginning the station was met with great enthusiasm, with 120 on staff in the fall semester in 1951, leading up to the station&#8217;s launch that November. By the following semester, they had a growing record collection, roster of regular shows, and even did a &#8220;continuous 13-hour broadcast&#8230;in which they kept students informed about classes and the effects of [a] storm,&#8221; according to a February 27, 1952 <a href="https://archive.org/details/Bates_Student_1951/page/n123/mode/2up?q=WVBC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> in <em>The Bates Student</em>. </p>

</div>


<p>WVBC was not without technical difficulties. In April 1952, an <a href="https://archive.org/details/Bates_Student_1951/page/n173/mode/2up?q=WVBC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> in the <em>Bates Student</em> joked, &#8220;It is now taken for granted that the left turntable is subject to extreme fits of temperament and will often refuse to comply with the requirements for records of different RPM. The present policy is to &#8216;let it go&#8217; if the song is relatively unfamiliar and will not sound too farfetched when speeded up or slowed down a bit.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Student Radio Goes FM with Launch of WRJR in 1958; Call Letters Later Change to WRBC</h2>



<p>In 1958, the student radio group at Bates received an license for 10 watt station WRJR 91.5 FM, with test programs beginning that fall out of the basement of Pettigrew Hall. WRJR officially launched in October, 1958. As AM was the norm at the time and not all students owned FM radios, WRJR worked to install converters &#8220;for the remaining students with AM sets,&#8221; according to an April 22, 1959 <a href="https://archive.org/details/Bates_Student_1958/page/n163/mode/2up?q=WRJR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> in the <em>Bates Student</em>. Circa 1981-1982 the station&#8217;s call letters were changed to WRBC.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WRBC in 2025</h2>



<p>Today, WRBC continues to be a completely student-run station. It has been located in its current home, the former Bates Alumni House, since 1978. While it occupies the basement, the upstairs rooms are used as office space for faculty. Programming runs from around 8am to midnight, with about 130 active DJs and around 70 shows. There are approximately 12 DJs from outside the campus community, some of whom have been on the air at WRBC for 20 to 30 years. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WRBC&#8217;s Large Physical Music Library</h2>



<p>WRBC has a large collection of vinyl records and CDs that are stored in its main library room, in hallway shelves and in the on-air studio. WRBC Community Liaison Olivia Torrington pointed out that most of the CDs have handwritten reviews on them and we noticed a few that were so old that the stickers were falling off as the adhesive had dried out. The collection is &#8220;loosely&#8221; organized alphabetically and by genre and the plan is to have new station interns working to get the library in better shape. </p>

<p>I was told that the vinyl records aren&#8217;t used as much as they&#8217;d like, in part because the turntable needles are currently broken. Community DJs are more likely to use CDs and vinyl. And occasionally students play physical music for the &#8220;novelty.&#8221; Although new DJs are trained on the audio equipment, the perception is that playing digital music is easier.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">DJs Play a Wide Mix of Music at WRBC</h2>



<p>While I was there a couple of students were wrapping up their team show for the evening. Between on-air banter, they played music, including a Beatles song. Madonna&#8217;s &#8220;Material Girl&#8221; was playing as I left the station, while later in the evening DJs were discussing the new Taylor Swift album, which had just been released. At other times that I&#8217;ve tuned in, I&#8217;ve heard a range of genres, including soul, rock, hip hop, electronic and pop. Other shows on the schedule dig in to jazz, blues, reggae, and more. When there isn&#8217;t a live DJ, an automated mix of music plays thanks to the station&#8217;s &#8220;Robo DJ.&#8221;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WRBC-DJs-IMG_7851.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WRBC-DJs-IMG_7851-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-52113" srcset="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WRBC-DJs-IMG_7851-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WRBC-DJs-IMG_7851-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WRBC-DJs-IMG_7851-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WRBC-DJs-IMG_7851.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>DJs on the air at college radio station WRBC.

</div>


<p>Like the rest of the station, the studio is full of artifacts from the past, starting with the sticker-covered door. A spiral-bound WRBC Dialogue Book from 2020 was on the counter, containing notes and drawings from DJs. A collection of carts with recorded station promotional spots (circa 1994-1997) are perched high on a shelf. Typed PSAs in plastic sleeves are available for DJs to read on-air. There is also a folder of CDs labelled &#8220;OND,&#8221; and posted instructions note that if Robo DJ isn&#8217;t working, one should play one of the overnight disks in lieu of the automated music mix. Audio equipment in the studio includes a mixing board, turntables, CD players, computer, microphones and headphones.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WRBC Events include Trivia Night</h2>



<p>In addition to their on-air activities, WRBC hosts events and special programming throughout the year, including a Halloween Bash, concerts and trivia nights. One wall of the music library has various sets of hash marks that were used to keep score during a past trivia night. Callers would contact the station with answers to trivia questions and station staff tallied up the answers on the wall.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>As we finished up the tour, WRBC co-General Manager Matt Riseman summed up what makes the station&#8217;s home so great. &#8220;It&#8217;s unique. It&#8217;s WRBC. You enter the space and you become a part of it. It&#8217;s awesome,&#8221; he mused, adding, &#8220;We are trying our best to keep Bates weird.&#8221; </p>

<p>In 2009, a <em>University of Denver Magazine</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240725011003/https://magazine-archive.du.edu/featured-categories/history/the-nine-lives-of-du-radio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">profile</a> of the school&#8217;s student radio station bore the headline, &#8220;The nine lives of DU radio.&#8221; It&#8217;s a fitting description for the ebb and flow of radio activity on the Colorado campus, where there have been at least 7 distinct stations since the 1940s. The current college radio station, KXDU, was founded in spring 2022 (see their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240530183957/http://kxduradio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">archived website</a> from 2023 in the Wayback Machine) and began streaming broadcasts in the 2023-2024 school year.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Touring College Radio Station KXDU</h2>



<p>Tucked into a small fishbowl-like room on the third floor of the Community Commons building, KXDU&#8217;s wall of windows look out over an undergraduate student lounge space. During my visit on October 23, 2025, students drifted in and out of the lounge to play pool, study or take a break. On that warm autumn afternoon, KXDU Audio Technician Grady Dionne and DJ Natalie Hultquist chatted with me about the station that they call home. Dionne is a senior and has been with KXDU since freshman year, whereas Hultquist is a brand new transfer student and had just joined the station. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/KXDU-View-In-IMG_9668.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/KXDU-View-In-IMG_9668-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-52068" srcset="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/KXDU-View-In-IMG_9668-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/KXDU-View-In-IMG_9668-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/KXDU-View-In-IMG_9668-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/KXDU-View-In-IMG_9668.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>View of KXDU from the undergraduate student lounge.

</div>


<p>The compact radio station space is minimally stocked with just what KXDU needs to get broadcasts out to listeners. There&#8217;s a desk, mixing board, computer, headphones, a few side tables, colorful chairs, and an ottoman. A collection of large posters tucked against a wall are reminders of the variety of events hosted by KXDU over the past few years. One thing that is absent is physical music.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Without a Website, KXDU Communicates through Instagram</h2>



<p>With no music library, KXDU relies on DJs to supply their own music. Additionally, there&#8217;s no functional website at the moment. The story goes that someone left the station and they lost the domain; subsequently the site hasn&#8217;t been updated in two years. Without a website, KXDU uses its <a href="https://www.instagram.com/duradiostation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram page</a> to get the word out about shows and provide a link to its stream. KXDU members have also been providing music coverage on their <a href="https://medium.com/@duradiostation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Medium blog</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Events, Concerts and Tiny Dorm Concerts</h2>



<p>Despite the station&#8217;s modest digs, KXDU makes a big impression with its events, shows, and live music sessions. Truly a community-focused endeavor, KXDU produces concerts featuring campus bands, DJs at events, and curates a series of live sessions highlighting student musicians. These Tiny Dorm Concerts began before KXDU had even launched a streaming radio station. The beautifully shot and edited live sets feature artists from University of Denver and are recorded in musicians&#8217; dorm rooms or residences, both on and off-campus. An archive of 12 episodes of Tiny Dorm Concerts can be viewed on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KXDUradio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KXDU YouTube page</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Campus Bands are Embraced by the University of Denver station</h2>



<p>Dionne is in charge of all of KXDU&#8217;s audio and video equipment and is very involved with Tiny Dorms. Immersed in music as a creator, student and professional, he is studying jazz guitar and audio engineering while also playing in bands and doing sound for shows. He described the local music scene as being very active with at least 10 to 15 bands on campus creating music influenced by pop, folk, and indie. He noted that shoegaze is also &#8220;pretty big&#8221; at the moment and said that he plays in a shoegaze band (Clove) and a post-punk band (Exhaler). </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Spreading the Word about KXDU through Shows</h2>



<p>In part because the concept of the radio station began before there was a live stream, KXDU focused initially on doing events. And these community-oriented events continue today. Dionne explained that events are also the best way that they attract new station members. Just before my visit, KXDU had hosted a house show, themed &#8220;indie sleaze,&#8221; and flyers were plastered all around campus to promote it. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Another big production is KXDU&#8217;s Spring Send Off music festival. Held at the end of the school year, it&#8217;s an all day event featuring 6 to 8 campus bands. The most recent Spring Send Off was in June 2025 and drew a few hundred attendees. Dionne said that the station typically works with another campus group for the festival and last spring they worked with the food pantry, even collaborating on merchandise.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fall 2025 Programming Rolling out at KXDU</h2>



<p>As far as the radio side of KXDU, the station and its new officers were just getting started for the school year when I visited. Around 20 people attend weekly club meetings and several hundred (some KXDU alumni) follow KXDU activities through their Slack channel. Programming is slowly rolling out, with around 8 DJs/hosts currently doing typically 2-hour shows on the KXDU stream. Dionne said that as new folks discover the club, they hope to expand their schedule to 5 days a week, but for the moment the KXDU program schedule is limited to Mondays and Tuesdays from 10am to 6pm. </p>

<p>Hultquist, along with a friend, just hosted her first show on KXDU. She told me that they plan to do themed shows every week and decided that with their inaugural show they would focus on playing music that they &#8220;grew up on&#8221; and the music that inspired their current music taste. She said it was fun to also send links to their families so that they could tune in. In speaking about future shows, Hultquist said that she planned to do a Halloween show and hoped to also do one about unrequited or &#8220;one-sided&#8221; love. </p>

<p>Dionne chimed in that he likes to play new music on his program. He&#8217;s done jazz shows and a number of thematic shows, including one for Valentine&#8217;s Day. While many DJs do their programs from the studio, Dionne does his from off-site since he has a fully outfitted home studio. Even though KXDU doesn&#8217;t have the tools to play physical music, Dionne will play vinyl records and CDs while DJing from home.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Legacy of Student Radio at University of Denver</h2>



<p>Although KXDU is a brand new organization as of a few years ago, its call letters hearken back to one of the many previous student radio stations at University of Denver. The full radio backstory was unknown to the current staffers who I met with, but Dionne mentioned that he thought there had been an FM station in the 1980s and that the student club started up again in the early 2000s and then died out. Luckily there is some written history about radio on campus and other clues can be found in defunct station websites and social media accounts. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">AM Carrier Current Station KVDU Launches in 1947</h2>



<p>A 2009 article in <em>University of Denver Magazine</em> points to AM carrier current station KVDU, which launched in 1947, as the first student station on campus. Lauded as &#8220;station of the month&#8221; in a March 1968 <a href="https://archive.org/details/collegeradiomarc00unse_1/page/10/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">profile</a> in <em>College Radio</em> magazine, KVDU at the time had 50 staff members and broadcast for 70 hours a week over carrier current at 670 AM. After more than 20 years of campus-only broadcasts, KVDU expanded to FM with the launch of KCFR in 1970, in order to reach a broader audience. Within the same school year, KVDU ceased its carrier current broadcasts. The following year, KCFR hired professional staff to run the station and &#8220;in 1984, KCFR became an independent community radio station — one of two stations that founded the Colorado Public Radio network,&#8221; according to the <em>University of Denver Magazine</em> piece.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Radio Redefined on Campus in the 1970s and 1980s with KAOS</h2>



<p>After the demise of carrier current station KVDU and the loss of student leadership at KCFR, a few other student radio stations appeared at University of Denver. These included KAOS from the early 1970s through at least the mid-1980s. <a href="https://specialcollections.du.edu/object/8be43f01-38dc-4233-931a-ad6af9bf2e7a#?c=&amp;m=&amp;s=&amp;cv=232&amp;xywh=-419%2C-32%2C1887%2C1518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A 1979 yearbook</a> photo bears the motto &#8220;KAOS: The Voice of Centennial Towers 670 AM.&#8221; In 1986, a yearbook article, &#8220;Crisis and Rebirth: The Fall and Rise of the Student Media,&#8221; mentioned challenges at all of the campus media organizations, including KAOS. It cited &#8220;inconsistent operations, considerable requests for funding and little staff training.&#8221; Another accounting of station history includes reference to the call letters KEGH, but the only item that I could find related to this was a 1982 headline in the DU student newspaper, <em>The Denver Clarion</em>, reading, &#8220;KEGH Future Unsure After Total Staff Loss.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Revival of KVDU as an Internet Station in 2001</h2>



<p>In 2001, KVDU &#8220;The Pioneer Sound&#8221; made its debut as an internet-only station. Its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010428080811/http://kvdu.du.edu/default.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">archived website</a> reads, &#8220;KVDU is the University of Denver&#8217;s Internet radio station. The entirely student-run station was launched on February 15th, 2001 after nearly two decades without student radio on the University of Denver campus. The broadcast originates on a Shoutcast server in the Driscoll University Center.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">KVDU Changes Name to KXDU in 2012</h2>



<p>KVDU seemed to ebb and flow for a few years, had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100201014802/http://kvdu.du.edu/content/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new website</a> and social media presence (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090526054342/http://www.myspace.com/kvdu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out its old MySpace page</a>) starting around 2009, and released a <a href="https://kvdu.bandcamp.com/album/kvdu-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live music compilation</a> in 2010. In February 2012, <a href="https://duclarion.com/2012/02/kvdu-takes-first-steps-towards-becoming-am-station-kxdu-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KVDU changed its call letters to KXDU</a> and had dreams of broadcasting over AM. After about a year of inactivity, another KXDU revival was organized in February 2014 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422233112/http://www.kxduradio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">view its old website on the Wayback Machine</a>) and seemed to be active through early 2016. It&#8217;s unclear for how long University of Denver was without a student radio station until the current iteration of KXDU was founded in 2022.</p>

<p>A sentence on the <a href="https://www.krcx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KRCX website</a>, “Regis University is home to Denver&#8217;s oldest college radio station,” piqued my interest and led to a journey not only through the radio station, but down many archival rabbit holes in search of more information. The story goes that the station began as a &#8220;dorm room shortwave broadcast,&#8221; but details of this mysterious beginning are absent from accounts of the station&#8217;s history.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Touring KRCX</h2>



<p>Within KRCX’s home in the basement of Clarke Hall, there are indicators that hint at the various stages and iterations of the long-time student-run station. Banners, stickers, show posters, awards and other ephemera reveal that the station held several spots on the dial, including 93.9 FM, 101.5 FM and 1530 AM. Posters and stickers from the 1990s and early 2000s cover various walls and doors, while shelves continue to house CDs. Older media and equipment dispersed around the station include records, mini discs, floppy discs, and a reel-to-reel machine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One wall of the office is decorated with vinyl records and covers. Discarded CDs had been smashed into bits for crafting sessions in the past, including some that were used to create disco balls at a station craft night and others that were incorporated into four panels that spell out the station&#8217;s call letters K-R-C-X.</p>

<p>As KRCX General Manager Magdalena Tapia toured me around the station on October 23, 2025, they pointed out the &#8220;history on the walls&#8221; of the station&#8217;s three rooms as well as various mysterious undated artifacts, including photos, event posters and a phone message log book. Tapia wasn’t sure how long the station had been around, but had been trying to sleuth out details about some of the objects floating around the station. Noting that Regis dates back to the 1800s, Tapia told me that Clarke Hall, home to KRCX, is rumored to be haunted. KRCX participants have shared tales of hearing things late at night and a former manager was so spooked that he would sleep at the station rather than venturing out the door in the wee hours.</p>

<p>While I didn’t uncover details about ghostly denizens, I was able to piece together a bit more about the trajectory of radio at Regis. As is the case on many campuses, student radio at Regis has operated under many different names and in a variety of locations over the years.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Early Days of Radio at Regis College in Denver</h2>



<p>In 1921, a wireless receiving set was installed at Regis College &#8220;partly as an experiment,&#8221; with plans in place to install a sending set and begin radio courses in 1922. According to a radio column in the campus paper on June 1, 1922, the receiving set had picked up &#8220;broadcasting programs, concerts, league scores, news digest, weather reports, and radio concerts.&#8221; </p>

<p>The earliest mentions of student-led radio endeavors that I could find at Regis were a yearbook entry for a radio club in the<a href="https://regis.lunaimaging.com/luna/servlet/detail/Regis~11~11~349~13953:1940-Ranger--Vol--35-"> 1940 Ranger</a> and news of an amateur radio station that same year. &#8220;Hall Harbors Ham Radio Operator,&#8221; reads a headline <a href="https://regis.lunaimaging.com/luna/servlet/detail/Regis~8~8~1501~20037:1940-Brown-and-Gold-Vol-22-No-07-Ja?sort=date&amp;qvq=w4s:/when%2F1940-01-12;sort:date;lc:Regis~8~8&amp;mi=0&amp;trs=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from January 12, 1940 in Regis College student newspaper The Brown and Gold</a>. The article profiles junior Bob Kelley, who had installed an amateur radio set in his dorm room on the second floor of Carroll Hall. Using the call W9QVZ, he was &#8220;operating on the 40 meter shortwave length&#8221; and was sending messages by code. At the time it was expected that within a month he would be able to &#8220;converse with the other Hams by voice also.&#8221; A <a href="https://cdm17478.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p17478coll1/id/81092/rec/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 5, 1940 article in the Denver Catholic Register</a> stated that Bob Kelley was running the &#8220;first and only &#8216;ham&#8217; radio station to be installed in Carroll hall&#8221; at Regis College.</p>

<p>Beyond the amateur radio work, the Regis College Radio department <a href="https://regis.lunaimaging.com/luna/servlet/detail/Regis~8~8~1504~20032:1940-Brown-and-Gold-Vol-23-No-01-Oc?sort=date&amp;qvq=w4s:/when%2F1940-10-04;sort:date;lc:Regis~8~8&amp;mi=0&amp;trs=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">produced radio plays in collaboration with the Rocky Mountain Radio Council</a>.

In 1943, as word of carrier current was spreading among colleges, Private Thomas W. Donaven of Regis College <a href="https://archive.org/details/sim_qst_1943-10_27_10/page/52/mode/2up">wrote in to QST magazine</a> asking if there were any carrier current stations in Denver.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New Radio Club and Carrier Current Station KREG Launch at Regis College in the 1950s</h2>



<p>By the 1953-1954 school year there was a new radio club at Regis College, whose purpose was &#8220;the training of those interested in radio announcing.&#8221; The<a href="https://regis.lunaimaging.com/luna/servlet/detail/Regis~11~11~356~9618:1954-Ranger--Vol--42-?sort=date&amp;qvq=sort:date;lc:Regis~11~11&amp;mi=14&amp;trs=76"> 1954 Regis Ranger</a> profile of the club states that the club &#8220;hopes in the future to build a Campus Radio Station.&#8221; Soon after, campus-only carrier current station KREG was launched at Regis. By the 1958-1959 school year it was broadcasting from DeSmet Hall, had a roster of 30 DJs and had conducted high profile interviews, including one with Hollywood star Mitzi Gaynor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And by 1960, KREG’s programming was piped into the Student Center. Interestingly, at the time KREG had implemented a &#8220;new policy of playing high quality music which benefits the college mind rather than the controversial form of rock and roll.&#8221; This switch aligned with a student opinion survey that &#8220;indicated a definite distaste for rock and roll.&#8221; The official yearbook photos of the station in 1960 show the all male staff sporting suits and ties. By 1961, the station had grown to around 50 participants and started renting records to students and campus organizations. Despite these accomplishments, KREG drifted away at some point in the 1960s.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Radio Revival with KRCR&#8217;s Debut in 1969</h2>



<p>A new station, KRCR, launched at Regis in October 1969, &#8220;after nine years and many futile attempts,&#8221; according to a profile in the<a href="https://regis.lunaimaging.com/luna/servlet/detail/Regis~11~11~371~9675:1970-Ranger--Vol--58-?sort=date&amp;qvq=sort:date;lc:Regis~11~11&amp;mi=30&amp;trs=76"> 1970 Ranger</a>. The piece claims that this new station was &#8220;conceived and founded&#8221; in spring 1961. Unlike its predecessor, the newly minted KRCR played rock music, along with popular music, jazz, soul, news and sports. In the early 1970s, KRCR embraced rock and roll and pushed the boundaries by airing “sarcastic sports commentary” and learning into “personality radio” with DJs like “The Stoned Ranger.” The marijuana jokes continued and by the<a href="https://regis.lunaimaging.com/luna/servlet/detail/Regis~11~11~379~9666:1978-Ranger--Vol--66-?sort=date&amp;qvq=sort:date;lc:Regis~11~11&amp;mi=38&amp;trs=76"> 1977-78 school year</a> KRCR 66 AM dubbed itself &#8220;Reefer Rock Radio,&#8221; after once again picking &#8220;itself out of the ashes.&#8221; Around this time it was broadcasting out of the Student Center.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1980s Name Change to KRCX</h2>



<p>During the 1985-1986 school year, KRCR changed its name to KRCX and was broadcasting to the dining hall and the three dorms over 660 AM. The station had a big listening audience during meal time and there were aspirations for &#8220;transmitting to all of Denver on an FM station,&#8221; according to the entry in the<a href="https://regis.lunaimaging.com/luna/servlet/detail/Regis~11~11~387~9808:1986-Ranger--Vol--74-?sort=date&amp;qvq=sort:date;lc:Regis~11~11&amp;mi=46&amp;trs=76"> 1986 Regis Ranger</a>. However, by the late 1980s and early 1990s, KRCX suffered a multitude of issues, including a mixing board fire and questions about finances and oversight. The station’s budget was frozen and the club was suspended. By the fall of 1992, KRCX was given a new advisor and was reorganized by the school’s communications board. At this point it was broadcasting from the basement of the O’Connell dorm, where it had moved circa 1990-1991. It continued its carrier current transmissions, bopping between 660, 580 and 590, while holding on to dreams of FM. Another move circa 1994 brought the station to the Media Center in the basement of the Student Center, from which KRCX broadcast an alternative music format.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">KRCX expands to FM in 1999</h2>



<p>By the 1998-1999 school year, KRCX was still on carrier current, moving from 1490 to 1530 on the AM dial. However, excitement was high for an even greater accomplishment, with KRCX beginning 101.5 FM broadcasts that reached one mile around the campus in spring 1999. The 1999 Regis Ranger yearbook<a href="https://regis.lunaimaging.com/luna/servlet/detail/Regis~11~11~397~13956:1999-Ranger?sort=date&amp;qvq=sort:date;lc:Regis~11~11&amp;mi=56&amp;trs=76"> wrote</a> that because of this, KRCX &#8220;became Denver&#8217;s first and only F.M. college radio station.&#8221; By the 1999-2000 school year, there was growing interest in the station from students, the outside community and record labels. </p>

<p>The number of DJs increased to around 70, plus 8 student staff members. Within a few years, KRCX was also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021201223211/http://academic.regis.edu/krcx/">online</a> and added streaming audio beginning circa 2005. Campus-only broadcasts continued over AM and FM and KRCX also expanded onto campus cable TV around this time. Within a few years, the spot on the dial moved to 93.9 FM and by 2009 KRCX was earning accolades from CMJ and covering the Democratic Convention.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2012-2013 Move to Clarke Hall, Exploration of LPFM</h2>



<p>During the 2012-2013 school year KRCX moved yet again, landing in the basement of Clarke Hall, where it continues to broadcast from today. Around this time, KRCX hoped to expand its reach off campus. It applied for a new low power FM (LPFM) license in 2013 and was awarded a construction permit for a station at 97.9 FM in 2014. That permit was cancelled in September 2017.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">KRCX in 2025</h2>



<p>Flash forward to 2025 and KRCX is in another phase of re-building. The student-run station has a small group of participants on work-study. General Manager Magdalena Tapia is a senior and has been involved with KRCX since freshman year. Initially learning about KRCX at an activity fair, Tapia joked that the draw was the promise of &#8220;free pizza&#8221; and a job. Tapia described the 2024-2025 academic year as a &#8220;rocky time,&#8221; with a series of technical challenges resulting in the station&#8217;s webstream being offline. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tech Challenges and Post-COVID Return</h2>



<p>Although the audio of the KRCX stream can now be heard in the KRCX basement studio, transmissions cannot be heard anywhere else. The station computer runs through a cycle of 46,000 songs and a mix of promotional announcements. DJs can interrupt that mix to do live programming, even though it remains confined to the station space. Tapia explained that while their broadcasts have been silenced, KRCX continues to do campus events &#8220;above ground.&#8221; This latest round of technical issues stem in part from an August <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/01/28/regis-university-ransomware-cyberattack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2019 cyberattack on Regis University</a>, that took down websites and systems on campus. A few months later, the coronavirus pandemic led to further disruptions, ultimately hampering the growth of KRCX and leading to a &#8220;slump,&#8221; according to Tapia. As is the case on many campuses, student organizations went through a period of transition after students returned following the easing up of COVID restrictions. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2025 Revamp of KRCX</h2>



<p>Tapia explained that this semester they are working to &#8220;revamp&#8221; KRCX by troubleshooting its tech issues while continuing to spread the word about the station through campus events. They expressed enthusiasm about the &#8220;passionate&#8221; group of participants who are keeping the station active through the creation of website content and events. The station&#8217;s blog is full of concert coverage, music reviews, music history, and more. Recent events have included a battle of the bands, karaoke nights, a Halloween open mic night, crafting sessions on the campus quad focused on coloring and kite-making, a Valentine&#8217;s Friendship Bingo night, and more.</p>

</div>


<p>Although KRCX wasn&#8217;t streaming at the time of my visit, the station did have the ability to play CDs and digital music. Sometimes they do receive vinyl records and CDs in the mail and Tapia said that in a period when they are flooded with digital music submissions, it&#8217;s exciting to be sent &#8220;a physical things that we can keep in the station,&#8221; as opposed to a &#8220;file that can get deleted.&#8221; As we traveled from room to room we spotted a package of vinyl records that had just been mailed to KRCX and Tapia said, &#8220;I wish we had a record player.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reminiscing about the time when KRCX could be heard on campus, Tapia talked about the thrill of having artists in the studio to talk about their work. Staffers have received media passes to concerts and one memorable experience was having indie band Yam Haus play on campus. Following that event, the band reached out directly to the station to offer them tickets, saying &#8220;we remember you.&#8221;</p>

<p>On Friday, October 3, as <a href="https://www.collegeradio.org/college-radio-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World College Radio Day</a> was being celebrated across the country and around the globe, students were locked out of their long-time home at college radio station WCSB 89.3 FM at Cleveland State University. Word soon spread that a deal had been struck between university leadership and local public radio organization Ideastream, allowing the group to utilize the WCSB frequency in order to broadcast jazz music programming from its <a href="https://www.ideastream.org/jazz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JazzNEO</a> service, which had previously been online and on 90.3 HD2.</p>



<p>Student leaders at WCSB were not informed of this plan until the day that <a href="https://www.csuohio.edu/news/cleveland-state-university-and-ideastream-public-media-announce-partnership-oversee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was announced to the public</a>. Soon after, the WCSB website (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250927032541/https://www.wcsb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see the last capture of their former website on Archive.org</a>) was taken down and WCSB leaders and participants were escorted out of their station by the police (<a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/cleveland-state-university-abruptly-ends-student-run-wcsb-radio-replaces-with-smooth-jazz-run-by-ideastream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see video of police arriving at WCSB from News 5 Cleveland</a>). Unaware of what was about to transpire, WCSB staff had been excitedly planning for their Halloween bash and for their upcoming 50th anniversary.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WCSB Supporters Voice Disappointment with the Deal</h2>



<p>In the ensuing weeks, WCSB supporters have been voicing their disappointment in this deal by holding protests, writing letters, initiating petitions, speaking to the media, participating in panel discussions, and engaging with local politicians. They have also built a new website, <a href="https://xcsb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XCSB &#8211; WCSB Reborn</a>. As a result of these efforts, on October 20, the Cleveland City Council adopted an <a href="https://cityofcleveland.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?From=RSS&amp;ID=7707538&amp;GUID=06126760-CB74-4B35-AF1E-0C8679085DB8&amp;G=2EB18EF1-2C21-4D1D-85C9-B38100AB8FFD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emergency resolution</a> &#8220;supporting the students and station members working to regain access to the 89.3 FM radio frequency and urging Cleveland State University to fully restore WCSB radio to its students.&#8221; The resolution reads in part that, &#8220;&#8230;this Council unequivocally supports the students and community members who continue to organize to reclaim their station and the culture of student-run WCSB 89.3 FM.&#8221; In response, there have been more than 250 public comments in support of the resolution.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Panel Discussion on Cleveland Radio Show Includes CSU and Former WCSB Leadership</h2>



<p>Local media outlets in Cleveland have been reporting on the WCSB shut-down and Ideastream even hosted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJWChBWuiZg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">panel discussion</a> on its editorially-independent public affairs program, <a href="https://www.ideastream.org/podcast/sound-of-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sound of Ideas</a>, on October 14. During that live radio show, the most recent WCSB General Manager Alison Bomgardner, former WCSB General Manager Lawrence Daniel Caswell, and numerous callers articulated what the loss of the FM signal means to students and the community. Cleveland State University President Dr. Laura Bloomberg and Ideastream President and CEO Kevin Martin spoke about their rationale for launching this &#8220;strategic partnership,&#8221; which took student radio off the local airwaves.</p>



<p>During the show on Sound of Ideas, Caswell spoke of his experience at WCSB as being &#8220;one of the most foundational things that I&#8217;ve ever done in my life.&#8221; He added that, &#8220;WCSB&#8217;s mission was always to provide programming and music to communities that were not otherwise served by radio in Northeast Ohio. It was the first really collaborative community that I was part of.&#8221; Bomgardner added that &#8220;89.3 was a laboratory of the cool,&#8221; explaining that the station pushed boundaries. While not offering a plan forward, Bloomberg complimented the former WCSB, saying &#8220;it&#8217;s a well-run student organization&#8221; and &#8220;should continue.&#8221;</p>



<p>Additionally, former WCSB advisor Daniel Lenhart joined the show by phone to express his concerns about the current situation at the radio station and the factors leading up to it. He also pointed out that the station &#8220;was started by students, not by the university&#8221; and that WCSB was &#8220;student-driven from the get-go.&#8221; After a flurry of calls against the deal, Bloomberg jumped in to say that &#8220;those are not the only voices we&#8217;re hearing&#8221; and suggested that &#8220;the pushback has a silencing effect on other people.&#8221; To counter the dissent, she argued that there was positive buzz for the deal during a fall visit day with prospective students and families that took place one day after the announcement. She stated that on that day future students were &#8220;excited about the possibilities.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Details of Partnership Outlined in Signed Agreements Between CSU and Ideastream</h2>



<p>According to a Program Service and Operating Agreement (<a href="https://signalcleveland.org/read-agreements-between-cleveland-state-ideastream-wcsb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obtained by Signal Cleveland</a>) signed by Cleveland State University and Ideastream on October 3, 2025, Ideastream will &#8220;provide noncommercial jazz music programming, educational news, and information programming&#8221; using the call sign WCSB. While there is no promised payment for this service, Ideastream will reimburse Cleveland State for &#8220;FCC-allowable operating expenses.&#8221; The agreement also allows Ideastream the &#8220;right to purchase the Station, including all assets used or useful in the operation thereof, by matching any bona fide offer received by Licensee&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Additionally, a Memorandum of Understanding (also obtained by Signal Cleveland) outlines further details of the deal between Cleveland State University and Ideastream. Notably, the MOU states that on the effective date of the agreement, &#8220;Ideastream will assume day to day operation of the Station&#8217;s digital platforms and products, including but not limited to the Station&#8217;s website, live streams, mobile applications, on-demand platforms, social media accounts, e-newsletters, and audience performance data systems&#8221; and &#8220;the WCSB.org URL shall be redirected to Ideastream&#8217;s website&#8230;&#8221; </p>



<p>Further, the MOU states that Cleveland State &#8220;covenants and agrees that during the term of the PSOA, the Station will be its sole radio station,&#8221; which calls into question whether or not the university has plans to allow student radio to continue in any form. Additionally, the MOU prohibits Cleveland State from soliciting &#8220;donations for JazzNEO programming and services or any services that compete for listeners or financial support with JazzNEO.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CSU President Bloomberg to Receive Spot on Ideastream Board of Trustees and Students to Receive Internships</h2>



<p>Perhaps the most surprising element of the agreement is that Ideastream is granting a seat on their Board of Trustees to the President of Cleveland State University during the term of the partnership. This includes voting rights. Ironically, during the radio interview on The Sound of Ideas, President Bloomberg acknowledged, &#8220;I&#8217;m not a media person,&#8221; when asked about details of the operating agreement.</p>



<p>The most-touted aspect of the deal for Cleveland State is that the partnership will offer &#8220;learning opportunities and talent development&#8221; according to the MOU. This includes &#8220;paid and for-credit internships, classroom-level projects and other opportunities&#8221; for CSU students in the fields of &#8220;journalism, television, and radio production, marketing and graphic design.&#8221; Another perk for CSU is that Ideastream will air underwriting announcements across its services.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, many questions have been circulating about what sparked this partnership. When asked, Bloomberg said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t specifically set out and say &#8216;let&#8217;s end student radio&#8217;.&#8221; In response, Caswell held her to task for not including students in the conversation. He pointed out that WCSB was &#8220;funded primarily with student tuition fees and community support.&#8221; Bomgardner added, &#8220;If students had their way, if I had my way&#8230;we would have an FM signal and that would be our preference.&#8221;</p>

</div>


<p>On Friday October 24, Bomgardner and former WCSB Business Manager Liam Main (who are both seniors at Cleveland State University) addressed a packed audience at a student media conference in Denver, Colorado. During their session, <a href="https://nsmcdenver25.sched.com/event/2AEuG/cleveland-doesnt-rock-wcsb-vs-csu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cleveland Doesn&#8217;t Rock: WSCB vs CSU</a>, at <a href="https://askcbi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">College Broadcasters Inc.</a>&#8216;s National Student Electronic Media Convention, they not only shared the story of what transpired with the station shutdown, but also offered tips and examples of warning signs that other college radio stations should watch out for. Main said that by speaking out and taking action this could be a way to show organizations that &#8220;we won&#8217;t allow you to replace college radio.&#8221;</p>



<p>While at the CBI convention, I sat down with Bomgardner to learn more about this fight. Despite all the challenges, she started the conversation by saying, &#8220;We&#8217;re in this really hopeful place now.&#8221; Taking a very direct, strategic stance, she and many others are working hard to try to get the FM signal returned for student use. She was excited by all the community support, telling me that she had just learned that a private individual had flown a plane over Cleveland State University that day with a message reading &#8220;CSU-Ideastream Sold &#8216;Em Out: Restore WCSB 89.3.&#8221; Bomgardner argued that in fighting this deal, &#8220;we have a chance to set a new precedent.&#8221; <br><br></p>

<p>One of the first things that I noticed when I arrived at <a href="https://www.wmpg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WMPG-FM</a> in Portland, Maine was a <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2015/06/solving-the-mystery-of-the-ubiquitous-radio-station-call-letter-signs-the-leo-blais-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">familiar-looking three-dimensional grey cardboard sign</a> perched in the lobby window. Hidden behind a chair and near stacks of bumper stickers, the sign is on my hypothetical radio station tour bingo card. Sent by musician Leo Blais many years ago, the hand-made WMPG sign has counterparts at college and community radio stations all over the United States. </p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t surprising to find this independent radio staple at the community radio station at the University of Southern Maine, since the rest of the station is full of funky ephemera. WMPG&#8217;s headquarters on the ground floor and in the basement of a former house (the student paper, The Free Press, is upstairs) is outfitted like a typical college radio station. Sticker-covered walls, shelves packed with CDs and vinyl records, and WMPG tchotchkes make for a colorful space from which to do radio.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WMPG&#8217;s Early Days of Campus-Only Broadcasts</h2>



<p>With humble beginnings in 1970 as pirate FM station WGOR broadcasting from a dorm room in Gorham, Maine (<a href="https://www.wmpg.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/HowardAllen40thvisit.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">listen to an interview with founder Howard Allen</a>), WMPG-FM operates today on 90.9 FM. The station has three full-time staff members and an active volunteer roster of more than 200 community members and students, around 110 to 120 of whom are on the air as programmers. The original station operated without a license as it broadcast to a very small radius on campus at 107 FM. With university approval, WGOR applied for an FM license and began provisional broadcasts of WMPG in 1973.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Documentary Puts WMPG in the Spotlight</h2>



<p>Fifty-five years after its initial dorm room transmissions, WMPG has been receiving worldwide attention thanks to a Tom Bell-directed documentary focusing on the story of this vibrant community radio station. The short film about WMPG, <a href="https://anextraordinaryplace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An Extraordinary Place</a>, has been screening at numerous events and festivals. Days before my visit, it received an honorable mention at the Love and Hope International Film Festival in Barcelona. It was up for &#8220;Best Documentary&#8221; at that festival and has been garnering awards at other festivals. A few days later, the film aired on public television in Maine, with a YouTube debut expected soon. With an emphasis on &#8220;the power of human connections,&#8221; the film depicts &#8220;the relationships among the station&#8217;s volunteers and its radio audience&#8230;through the lens of love of music,&#8221; according to its producers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">College Radio Station that Embraces Community</h2>



<p>Although I have yet to see the film, I was able to get a sense of the strong community and the love for music at WMPG during my visit. Program Director David Rogers-Berry shared with me the state of the station while leading me on a tour on a busy Tuesday afternoon in October. We talked about how WMPG is a bit of a hybrid station as it has historically drawn many of its programmers from the broader community. He said that over the past few years there has been both a mandate and a concerted effort to increase student involvement and get new voices on the air. As we chatted, numerous students were milling about the station shadowing DJs and having meetings with station staff. And Rogers-Berry noted that it hasn&#8217;t been that difficult attracting more students to the station, especially post-pandemic, during which he&#8217;s noticed a lot of &#8220;momentum&#8221; at WMPG.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Freeform Radio Station that Supports Local Music</h2>



<p>A freeform station, WMPG is trying to have more of a &#8220;curatorial voice,&#8221; according to Rogers-Berry. He pointed out a section of new music assembled by the music department. The collection of CDs and vinyl records featured a mix of genres, including ambient experimental and a compilation of rare synth wave from Eastern Europe from the late 1970s and early 1980s. The music director notes on that release that it is &#8220;unknown and unstreamable!&#8221; While DJs are not required to play new music, this section is a way to encourage programmers to dig in to not only new and local music, but to also explored some gems being highlighted from the station archives. </p>

</div>


<p>Another way that WMPG emphasizes new and local music is through the long-running show <a href="https://www.wmpg.org/show/wed1930-localmotives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Local Motives</a>. Every Wednesday evening an artist/bands comes to the studio to play a 35 to 40 minute live session. 2025 has been particularly active for the show, with nearly 50 bands having come through by the time that I visited in October. Over the summer they also experimented with setting up bands to play just outside the station, on the driveway adjacent to the WMPG building. A snake was passed through a window to the set-up outside and these sets were dubbed &#8220;Live from the Drive.&#8221; One goal was to attract an in-person audience for those sessions. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WMPG&#8217;s Youth Radio Program and Remote Broadcasts</h2>



<p>Another interesting and long-running program (since 1994!) at WMPG is <a href="https://www.bluntradio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blunt Youth Radio</a>, a Thursday evening show that features young people from the community. A free after school program, Blunt Youth Radio, invites Maine high school students to produce radio and podcasts from a dedicated studio at WMPG.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<p>Live music in the studio and the youth radio programming are a couple of ways that WMPG brings the community in to the station. On the flip side, WMPG also does events in the local area, including live Friday night broadcasts, <a href="https://www.wmpg.org/freaky-fridaze/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Freaky Fridaze</a>, from various venues. For October 2025, WMPG DJs played music live from a craft brewery in Portland.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Record Library Reorganization in the Works</h2>



<p>Like many of the stations that I visited this fall, WMPG is in the midst of reorganizing its physical music collection. While there was music throughout the station, the basement is home to a large media library of CDs and vinyl. On the way down to the packed space, I was charmed by a door nearly covered with radio station stickers. As an aficionado of radio station stickers, I appreciate the effort to consolidate all the radio stickers in one place. I was told that they were mostly collected at <a href="https://nfcb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NFCB</a> (National Federation of Community Broadcasters) conferences over the years. Impressively, stickers spanned the entire United States, representing stations from places far from Maine, including Alaska, Hawaii, California, Washington, Wisconsin, and more.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WMPG-Sticker-Door-IMG_8149.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WMPG-Sticker-Door-IMG_8149-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-51939" srcset="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WMPG-Sticker-Door-IMG_8149-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WMPG-Sticker-Door-IMG_8149-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WMPG-Sticker-Door-IMG_8149-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WMPG-Sticker-Door-IMG_8149.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Door covered with radio station stickers at KMPG-FM.

</div>


<p>Rogers-Berry explained a bit about the current CD reorganization project, telling me that WMPG is working to cull about 60% of the CD collection. He said that in the past the library was filed chronologically and in an effort to save space, CD jewel cases were replaced with thinner sleeves. As the years went by, it became clear to WMPG that the thinner cases made finding music quite difficult. So now, the plan is to bring back jewel cases so that the library is browse-able. He told me that by reducing the size of the collection, the desire is to have a &#8220;curated&#8221; and &#8220;usable&#8221; library as opposed to one that is  &#8220;comprehensive.&#8221; Station volunteers with expertise in various genres are doing the decision-making regarding what music is culled. &#8220;We&#8217;re going from a museum to a library,&#8221; noted Station Manager Jim Rand, as we chatted in his office at the end of my visit.</p>

</div>


<p>Although a portion of the CD collection is leaving the station, WMPG is working to preserve other objects and ephemera related to the station&#8217;s history. Rand shared with me a scrapbook created by WGOR/WMPG founder Howard Allen, which was full of amazing photos, clippings and artifacts from the early days of student radio at University of Southern Maine (USM). Other materials have been preserved on campus through the <a href="https://digitalcommons.usm.maine.edu/wmpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USM Digital Commons</a>. As we spoke, he pointed to the an early WMPG bumper sticker that reads &#8220;Maine&#8217;s radio oasis,&#8221; which was affixed to his office door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Walk to the front between the two large turrets!&#8221; read the text message from <a href="https://www.wzly.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WZLY</a> historian Berit Raines, directing me to the entrance of Billings Hall, a gothic 1904 building that is home to the Wellesley College radio station as well as various student services and administrative offices. While walking across the lushly landscaped campus on a crisp autumn morning, I felt like I was stepping back in time and it was a fitting introduction to student-run organization that is steeped in history and traditions.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wellesley College Radio Dates Back to 1942</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2012/05/wellesley-college-celebrates-70-years-of-college-radio-on-campus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One of the first carrier current stations at a historically women&#8217;s college</a>, WBS (for Wellesley Broadcasting System), launched on April 20, 1942 as a campus-only AM station in Wellesley, Massachusetts. This was very early days for carrier current, with organized efforts beginning with the launch of the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS) in 1940. Prior to that time, Brown University students created their own system before helping to found IBS in order to assist other radio clubs in building stations. Women&#8217;s colleges like Wellesley were part of those efforts.</p>

</div>


<p>After decades of campus-only AM broadcasts, WBS worked to expand its potential listening audience in the 1970s. This eventually resulted in the 1976 launch of class D station WZLY on 91.5 FM, which continues to be the station&#8217;s spot on the dial. When I visited, the FM signal wasn&#8217;t up and running, but it was hoped that the technical issues would soon be resolved. Signs of the station&#8217;s past were sprinkled throughout their funky basement space, which WZLY has inhabited since 1983. Flyers celebrating the station&#8217;s 80th anniversary included vintage photos, and an old mixing console dating from the carrier current era was propped near the on-air studio.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wellesley College Traditions at WZLY</h2>



<p>WZLY has unique traditions and even slang that ties in with the culture at Wellesley. Several hoops were attached to lights near a purple stole decorated with a screen-printed WZLY logo. Graduating seniors participate in a hoop rolling contest, which is a ritual dating back to the founding of Wellesley in the 1800s. Raines mentioned that different campus organizations have their own hoops, which members can use. Stoles are worn during commencement as a symbol of participation in various groups, including the radio station.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Preserving Material Culture at WZLY</h2>



<p>Telling me that the station was &#8220;kind of in flux,&#8221; Raines explained that WZLY had just begun broadcasting for the semester the week before my visit. As the term was getting underway various projects were in the works, including one to organize and re-shelve the large library of CDs. Raines was recently elected to the historian role and at WZLY that executive board (E-board) position is responsible for both creating and preserving &#8220;material culture&#8221; for the organization. Some of the related projects include making a broadcast schedule poster, doing a senior photo shoot and creating graduation stoles. The station historian is also responsible for bringing station-produced items to the college archives every year.</p>

</div>


<p>I was pleased to also hear that WZLY has collaborated with the archives at Wellesley College and has drawn inspiration for current promotional items from historical materials. At Wellesley College the term &#8220;spam&#8221; is used to describe posters, flyers and zines created to promote student organizations and departments. Raines explained that some of these items are stamped with an expiration date and posted on cork boards around campus, which are called &#8220;spam boards.&#8221; In a recent spam-making party, members of the station crafted WZLY-themed decorations to post on their dorm room doors as a way of showing pride in their affiliation with the college radio station.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">DIY Promotional Materials and Messages on the WZLY Walls</h2>



<p>Handmade WZLY program guides and zines were in various places throughout the station, including a recent <a href="https://www.wzly.org/spam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mini-zine</a> that was comprised of flyers that DJs made for their shows during a spam-making workshop. I was told that the station attracts an especially crafty group of folks and that creativity extends throughout WZLY&#8217;s physical space. Messages and drawings are inked on walls and ceilings and graduating seniors typically leave their mark with heartfelt parting words. Raines plans to scan the walls in order to create a preservable digital representation, especially since other campus spaces have lost similarly graffitied walls after renovations. Raines explained that, &#8220;I feel like it&#8217;s one of the most significant visual aspects of the space. I don&#8217;t think it would be the studio without the writing on the walls.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Touring WZLY&#8217;s Charming Basement Space</h2>



<p>Upon descending into the basement digs of WZLY, one arrives at a large open area with a cluster of couches, comfy chairs, sticker-covered tables, and shelves of CDs. A low ledge provides more seating and a step up to a narrow stage-like area where the hoops and stole were displayed. Off to the side is a mysterious small door and graffiti next to it reads &#8220;sex cave.&#8221;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<p>From that main lobby-like area a few steps take one down to two studios &#8211; a training studio (studio B) and the on-air booth (studio A). Between the studios is a narrow tech room with windows overlooking both studios. Outside the studios are more shelves of CDs and some vinyl records. A treehouse-like listening nook is nearby and one can climb a short ladder to ascend into the carpeted mini loft. Old copies of the WZLY program guide, original handmade collaged flyers and music magazines are stashed away in this area so that station members wanting to take a break can peruse the collection of reading material.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Handmade &#8220;Rules&#8221; Signs Adorn the Studio Walls</h2>



<p>During my visit it was between live shows, so the studios were empty and dark. Signs covered the walls describing various rules, including lists of words not to say on the area and pleas to &#8220;not offend the locals.&#8221; One sign had the message, &#8220;If you wouldn&#8217;t say it around Grandma, don&#8217;t play or say it on the air! AVOID THE OBSCENE,&#8221; and was illustrated with a photo of an older woman holding a cat. Apology notes were scattered about the studio and I was told that this was another rule and tradition for DJs who accidentally swear on the air or play songs with dirty words. </p>

<p>A few lined &#8220;Matilda&#8221; notebooks were on the counter and were filled with messages and artwork scribbled by DJs during their shows. Similar to DJ notebooks that I&#8217;ve seen at other college radio stations, Raines told me that they are a long-time WZLY tradition that serves as a &#8220;journal&#8230;within the studio&#8230;for DJs,&#8221; in which they &#8220;write little sign-offs&#8221; and &#8220;write about their days&#8221; and &#8220;draw little pictures.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">100+ Members and More than 80 shows on WZLY in Fall 2025</h2>



<p>This semester there are around 80 programs on the WZLY schedule, with shows running from around 8am until midnight. When there isn&#8217;t a live DJ or host an automated mix of music (new each month and called heavy rotation), curated by the WZLY music department, plays. The station is led by students on its E-board, managing a variety of committees that include campus events, music directory, tech, business, outreach, etc. </p>

<p>With around 100 active members, WZLY&#8217;s shows are produced and hosted by students, but anyone can listen online, which is important because the FM range is limited. Raines said that parents and friends from home tend to listen. While writing this piece I tuned in to a show during which a DJ and sibling joked about their parents being the only listeners.</p>

<p>Raines mentioned that some DJs are expressing interest in playing CDs and vinyl records, although while we were in the on-air studio a digital mix of music was playing and the turntables were not in working order. In describing the October 2025 mix curated by the music directory committee, Raines characterized it as &#8220;very autumnal.&#8221; The training studio had recently been refreshed with some new microphones and other audio equipment. Turntables looked to be in working order and there were even cassettes in that room. Raines speculated that the music directory group may be working to activate that space for special live music programming in addition to the studio&#8217;s use during intern training. </p>

<p>As I was about to depart, interns began trickling in for a session in the studio with intern coordinator Maddie Hansen. Hansen mentioned that as a senior she was already starting to feel nostalgic about her time at the station, as she had been participating since her first semester in college. Raines is a junior and joined WZLY last year. Reflecting on her time at the station she told me, &#8220;I love the community of WZLY! I have a show with one of my wonderful friends (Stephanie), and together we have Sunday &#8216;Mornings&#8217; with DJ Ama and DJ B, and it is a great way to block out the time to hang out.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thanks to WZLY + Full List of Station Tours</h2>



<p>Thanks to WZLY for the wonderful tour! It was such a treat to visit a college radio station that not only has so much history, but that also actively works to save materials related to their history. This is my 180th radio station tour report and my 122nd college radio station tour.

<p>&#8220;The station&#8217;s in a bit a flux,&#8221; <a href="https://campusgroups.brandeis.edu/wbrs/home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WBRS</a> co-General Manager Ella Thanik said apologetically, after enthusiastically greeting me at the Brandeis University college radio station around lunchtime on a Thursday in early October. The student-run station had recently been painted and various items still hadn&#8217;t returned to their proper homes. A large dry erase board at the WBRS entrance had an alert scrawled on it: &#8220;Attention WBRS Users! Please excuse our appearance temporarily. We are in the midst of a studio refresh!&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of these warnings, WBRS felt not only tidy, but cheerful. Sun streamed in the windows of the space, which is located on the third floor of the Shapiro Campus Center. On the day of my visit, the lobby of the building was quite lively, with students checking out vendors who were taking part in an Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Day event.</p>

<p>As Thanik and Programming Director Lily Fasciano began to lead me around WBRS, a group of folks arrived for their radio show, which was produced as part of a Hebrew class. During their hour in the on-air studio, we toured the rest of the station, taking a look at the record library, production studios, office spaces, and gathering areas.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Huge Record Library is Full of Vinyl, CDs and Cassettes</h2>



<p>A large room labeled &#8220;storage&#8221; is home to the WBRS record library/archives, full of high density rolling shelves packed with vinyl records and CDs. Thanik said that at one point it was purportedly the largest record collection in the northeast, but she conceded that it is no longer the case. Cassettes of old WBRS recordings are contained in stacked boxes in the same room. Many of them are from long-running shows <em>The Joint</em> and <em>WBRS Coffeehouse</em>, and document live performances recorded for on-air broadcast.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WBRS-TheJoint-IMG_8969.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WBRS-TheJoint-IMG_8969-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-51850" srcset="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WBRS-TheJoint-IMG_8969-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WBRS-TheJoint-IMG_8969-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WBRS-TheJoint-IMG_8969-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WBRS-TheJoint-IMG_8969.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Cassette tape recording from The Joint, a college radio show on WBRS-FM.

</div>


<p>While surveying the room, Thanik and Fasciano told me that there&#8217;s interest in creating a dedicated space to record live music for broadcast, along the lines of NPR&#8217;s <em>Tiny Desk Concert</em>. The music library is one contender and they imagined having the shelves of records as a backdrop. This &#8220;archive room&#8221; also contains a turntable and I was told that there is also hope for this space to become a listening room as well, allowing DJs to come through and preview physical media from the vast WBRS collection.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tech Challenges and Projects at WBRS</h2>



<p>A class D FM station, WBRS broadcasts at 100.1 FM to a small radius near the Brandeis University campus in Waltham, Massachusetts, west of Boston. The station also streams online, although its full website was down at the time of my visit. Thanik and Fasciano explained that WBRS has had a variety of technical issues and tasks recently, including tower maintenance over the summer. It was hoped that the website would soon be fully operational again.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WBRS-Sticker-IMG_9035.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WBRS-Sticker-IMG_9035-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-51856" srcset="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WBRS-Sticker-IMG_9035-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WBRS-Sticker-IMG_9035-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WBRS-Sticker-IMG_9035-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WBRS-Sticker-IMG_9035.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>WBRS sticker on a cabinet at the Brandeis University college radio station.

</div>


<p>Other projects in the works at WBRS include creating a dedicated recording studio in a small studio (labeled &#8220;live engineering studio&#8221;) along the same hallway as the on-air studio. Currently filled with a nearly complete drum set, the space is envisioned to serve as a satellite location for an already-operational live recording set-up at the campus library called SIMS (Sound and Image Media Studios). In addition to offering studio spaces, SIMS also loans out audio-visual equipment. A subgroup within the station, The WBRS Student Music Committee, is working on the live recording studio and other music projects. It also has an office/closet at the radio station, where it houses even more music and sound equipment.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Touring WBRS: Funky Decor and Surprises Behind Every Door</h2>



<p>Right next to the Student Music Committee office are large windows, which help to flood light into a small seating area. A life-size cardboard cut-out of film character Ron Burgundy (a promotional item that <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/?s=%22ron+burgundy%22&amp;submit=Search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I&#8217;ve oddly seen at multiple college radio stations</a>) stands by the door to the office. He&#8217;s been decorated with a straw hat, WBRS T-shirt and sunglasses. A large mixing board is set up on a stand in that corner, with Burgundy looking over it.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<p>Other station spaces include a manager office, which is mainly used for storage. And next to the on-air studio is a room labeled &#8220;recording studio,&#8221; that is typically a place where people do live DJ mixing. Across the hall is a door labeled Radio Tech/Tech Closet 1, serving as both storage and office space. Industrial desks are on one side of the room, with file cabinets on the other. We took a little treasure hunt through the drawers and found many gems, including paper playlists, flyers, station newsletters, and equipment manuals. </p>

</div>


<p>A funny thing about the offices and studios throughout WBRS is that they have very official door signs on them with titles that don&#8217;t necessarily match the current use of the spaces. An example of that is that the tech room has a handmade paper sign on it that reads &#8220;Welcome to the Music Office. Welcome to the Tech. Office. Uhhhh&#8230;&#8230;Welcome to THE OFFICE!&#8221; In typical college radio style, that door is also covered with band and music-related stickers, miscellaneous notes, and other artifacts, including a tiny plastic alien.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fall 2025 Schedule with Range of Shows</h2>



<p>WBRS is led by 15 student managers who serve on the executive board of the station. Around 45 DJs/hosts are on the schedule this semester, with the vast majority students. The handful of community DJs include a DJ who has been at WBRS since 1977. Andy Nagy has been hosting &#8220;<a href="https://spinitron.com/WBRS/show/42947/Black-Jack-Davy?page=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Jack Davy</a>&#8221; all this time. Focused on folk and roots music, the program is rumored to be &#8220;one of the longest running folk radio programs in the country, if not the world!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Checking out the On-Air Studio</h2>



<p>Hosts and DJs broadcast from the on-air studio. A nicely appointed room, the studio is decorated with throw rugs, a bust sculpture, a funky floor lamp and two couches (one black leather and another of the dorm-issued variety with wooden framing). Sort of a glass box, the on-air studio is visible to everyone walking through the station. Large windows overlook the hallway, another window provides a glimpse of outside, while another looks into the DJ mixing studio. The on-air studio is outfitted with a mixing board, microphones, turntables, headphones, CD players and a computer.</p>

<p>Even though WBRS is still rethinking studio spaces and getting items back on the walls, creative energy still oozes out of the space. Posters and framed vintage t-shirts are propped outside the studio, providing a snapshot of some of the enviable shows that WBRS helped to present, including performances by Black Flag and Live Skull. A very DIY zine is atop a pile of ephemera by the station door, a souvenir of a recent semesterly &#8220;zine night&#8221; in which station members come together to collaborate in making a zine using paper, scissors, markers and other craft supplies. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Brief History of WBRS</h2>



<p>A long-time radio station, WBRS is the descendant of a 1950s student radio club and carrier current station at Brandeis originally known as WLDB. After renaming itself WBRS (for Brandeis Radio Service) the club launched a campus-only carrier current station circa 1961. In 1968, the group was granted a class D FM license and began broadcasts over 91.7 FM. WBRS moved up the dial to 100.1 FM in 1984 and continues to broadcast with a class D license. Reflecting on that history, WBRS co-General Manager Ella Thanik shared, &#8220;I love being able to continue such a long standing legacy! We are one of the oldest clubs at Brandeis, and being able to carry on something that has been important to so many people in our community is such a cool experience.&#8221;</p>

		</p>
<p>Over the years there have been so many reports about the ebb and flow of college radio and I&#8217;ve tried my best to not feed into narratives of decline. With that in mind, I was pleased to read a piece this week from Emily White, <a href="https://emwhitenoise.substack.com/p/gen-zs-college-radio-revival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gen Z&#8217;s College Radio Revival</a>, which outlines feelings about college radio from current participants. It&#8217;s eerily like a glimpse into some of my recent <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/radio-station-tours/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">college radio station tours</a>, on which I&#8217;ve met so many enthusiastic young people who are dedicating their time to their home stations. Is this a revival or just part of the natural cyclical nature of college radio stations, as members join and often graduate a few years later?</p>



<p>One thing that is for certain is that college radio faced many challenges during the 2020 COVID pandemic and its ensuing years of lock-downs and limited access to campuses and studio spaces. Since I resumed my station tours in 2022, I&#8217;ve met with many college radio participants who have talked about having to <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2022/12/radio-station-visit-166-college-radio-station-wcdb-at-university-at-albany/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rebuild station culture</a> after students returned to campus. Many have also reported that institutional memory was lost during that time, which can have both negative and positive implications. In some cases station leadership opted to rethink mission statements and policies to make radio station spaces more inclusive.</p>



<p>As Emily White learned while surveying college radio participants, interest and engagement is quite high at many stations. I heard similar sentiments while visiting radio stations this week. Wesleyan University station <a href="https://www.wesufm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WESU</a> had representatives at a school activities fair last week and as a result, 140 students signed up for radio station training. <a href="https://laurenkhall.nekoweb.org/website/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WCFM</a>, the student-run radio station at Williams College, currently has around 130 DJs (and total college enrollment is close to 2,000). Bennington College&#8217;s station, <a href="https://www.benningtonradio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">B-Rad</a>, has approximately 50 DJs, which is even more impressive since the campus population is less than 800 students. WCFM General Manager Olivia Johnson, a college senior, articulated to me that the Williams College station provides an important creative outlet and that as a student, listening to others&#8217; shows is a way to feel connected to fellow classmates through the lens of personal music taste.</p>



<p>In celebration of <a href="https://www.collegeradio.org/college-radio-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">College Radio Day</a>, I hope you will tune in to a station near you or at your alma mater or simply a random station that you&#8217;ve found online or in my <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/radio-station-tours-in-numerical-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">archive of radio station tours</a>.</p>

<p>Jennifer Waits reports back from the Grassroots Radio Conference, held in Spokane Washington from September 11 to September 14, 2025. We recap FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez&#8217;s keynote address, in which she spoke forcefully about recent actions by the FCC that threaten freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Gomez talked about the importance of community radio, as a place that inherently provides a diversity of view points.</p>



<p>Also on the show, we hear a bit about the National Campus and Community Radio Conference, which was held in Nanaimo, BC, Canada in June 2025. Plus, Jennifer digs into the latest &#8220;best college radio stations&#8221; list from Princeton Review.</p>

Appearing within <em><a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/best-colleges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best 391 Colleges</a> – 2026 edition</em>, the &#8220;<a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/?rankings=best-college-radio-station" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best college radio station</a>&#8221; list shines a spotlight on 25 schools with radio stations deemed the most popular based on student surveys.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New Entrants to the List Hit the Top 10</h2>



<p>A highlight of the new list is that it features four schools that have never appeared in the &#8220;Best College Radio Station&#8221; list in the 30+ years of its publication. Notably, two of those schools made their debut on the list by appearing in the Top 10. Washington and Lee University came in at #3 and Rollins College is in the 9th slot. Additionally, two schools on this year&#8217;s list hadn&#8217;t appeared on the &#8220;Best College Radio Station&#8221; list in 20 years or more.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">East Coast Dominates</h2>



<p>Once again, the Princeton Review list is a mix, including large universities with multiple radio stations as well as small liberal arts colleges with online-only stations. The biggest school on the list is Arizona State (with 195,000+ students) and the tiniest is Bennington College (797 undergraduates). I am also pleased to have visited college radio stations at <s>6</s> <s>7</s> 8 out of the 25 schools on the list.</p>



<p>The East Coast still dominates, although there was a slight increase in representation this year in other regions. California is once again absent from the list. In this edition, 11 schools from the northeast made the cut (3 from New Jersey, 3 from Massachusetts, 2 from New York, 1 from Vermont, 1 from Pennsylvania, and 1 from Maine). From the Midwest, the 6 schools hail from Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, and Ohio (2). On the west coast, only 3 schools are represented (1 from Washington and 2 from Oregon). The three schools from the South are from Florida (2) and Virginia. And the Southwest is represented by two schools, one each in Texas and Arizona.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best = Popular</h2>



<p>As a reminder, although the Princeton Review describes its college radio results as “Best College Radio Station,” the title doesn’t tell the whole story. Here’s the scoop:</p>



<p>1. Results are based on student surveys</p>



<p>2. Surveys were conducted at 391 colleges. Per Princeton Review, &#8220;They constitute only about 15% of America&#8217;s nearly 2,400 four-year institutions.&#8221;</p>



<p>3. Students are asked to <strong>judge the popularity</strong>, not the quality, of an unspecified campus radio station <strong>at their own college</strong></p>



<p>4. Radio stations are not named in the survey or in the resulting rankings</p>



<p>5. Only schools surveyed can make it into the rankings, so college radio stations at schools that are not surveyed by Princeton Review won’t appear on the list</p>



<p>A number of colleges appearing on the “Best College Radio Station” list have multiple radio stations, including student-run stations, large public radio stations, and everything in between. It makes sense that students would indicate that their school’s radio station is “popular” if they are on a campus with a high profile professional radio station and/or with several radio stations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Digging into Methodology</h2>



<p>According to Princeton Review, ”We tallied the rankings lists in the current edition of&nbsp;The Best&nbsp;391 Colleges (published August 2025) based on the data from our surveys of&nbsp;170,000 students at the&nbsp;391 schools in the book.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The site says that the “Best College Radio Station” list is compiled “based on students’ answers to the survey question, ‘How popular is the college radio station?,” but in recent years, the question was phrased a little differently. For the 2021 edition’s list, the survey asked, “<em>How much do you agree or disagree with the following statements at your school?” </em>Among the list of statements was: <em>“College Radio Station is popular.” </em>Respondents were given the following options:<em> Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neither Agree or Disagree, Agree or Strongly Agree.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1501699323692_37177">How Similar is this Year’s List to Prior Lists?</h2>



<p>For the 2026 Princeton Review list of “Best College Radio Stations,” 17 of the 25 schools were on the 2025 list. <strong>Washington and Lee University</strong>, <strong>Rollins College</strong>, <strong>John Carroll University</strong> and <strong>University of Portland</strong> are brand new entrants, not having appeared during the entire history of Princeton Review lists going back to the 1993 edition. The other four schools that did not appear last year include Rice University (last appeared on 2002 list), Grinnell College (last appeared on 2006 list), Monmouth University (last appeared on 2021 list) and Macalester College (last appeared on 2024 list).</p>



<p>Those that fell off the list this year were Skidmore College, Carleton College, Princeton University, Saint Michael&#8217;s College, DePauw University, Allegheny College, Washington State University, and Hamilton College.</p>



<p>The complete list for the 2026 edition is listed below.

<p>While the work of radio stations using terrestrial transmitters is a typical discussion topic on Radio Survivor, for this episode we find ourselves examining music and talk beamed down from satellites orbiting the earth. Satellite radio as we know it began in the 1990s, with its major players launching satellite radio services in the early 2000s. Brian Fauteux, Associate Professor of Popular Music and Media Studies at University of Alberta joins us on the show to discuss the fascinating history and relevance of satellite radio to both radio culture and the music industry. Brian is the author of the new book, “Music in Orbit: Satellite Radio in the Streaming Space Age,” released in 2025.</p>

<p>The magic of college radio lies not just in the sounds that are transmitted over the airwaves, but also emanates from the spaces from which stations operate. Often these are in obscure locales, tucked away in basements or on the edge of a campus. And sometimes the buildings themselves have their own unusual story, like the former student bank that houses <a href="https://www.cjsr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CJSR 88.5 FM</a> at University of Alberta. Seizing on the opportunity to embrace a funky feature of the space, the campus and community radio station built its on-air studio out of the old vault. DJs enter through the thick, heavy red door to do their shows. And because of its weight, the door is always kept ajar, even though this means that sound from the studio wafts into the record library and vice versa.</p>

<p>While I love the story of the bank vault, I was also enamored with so much more at CJSR. My first visit to a station in Canada, the tour took place during a break while I was attending the <a href="https://spokenweb.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpokenWeb</a> Symposium and Institute on the campus in Edmonton in May, 2023. Two long-time CJSR staff members, Program Director Chad Brunet and Music Librarian/Production Coordinator Matthew Gooding, showed me around the station&#8217;s basement digs in the Students&#8217; Union building at University of Alberta.</p>

<p>In our wide-ranging conversation, we touched on everything from weird station traditions to the challenges of coming back after COVID to the maximalist office decor to some of the gems that have passed through the station&#8217;s treasure chest full of freebies. It was another one of those visits for me where it was difficult to leave, as I furiously tried to capture every last detail about the surroundings.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">History of CJSR-FM  </h2>



<p>Launched over FM in 1984, CJSR has deep ties with its home institution, but is run by the not-for-profit First Alberta Campus Radio Association (FACRA), which holds its broadcast license. More than a third of the station&#8217;s budget comes from the University of Alberta Students&#8217; Union. Dedicated fees from membership in the Students&#8217; Union help fund not only the radio station, but also a student newspaper, campus food bank, health service, and more. With a very small staff, CJSR relies on its nearly 300 volunteers to keep the radio station running.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">University of Alberta Radio Dates Back to the 1920s</h2>



<p>Although CJSR&#8217;s FM signal debuted in 1984, campus radio at University of Alberta began with broadcasts over Edmonton radio station CJCA in 1925. Two years later, the school bought local radio station CFCK, changed the call letters to <a href="https://ckua.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CKUA</a> and ran the station as an educational broadcaster over AM beginning in 1927. CKUA&#8217;s studios were moved off campus in 1955 and its license was transferred to Alberta Educational Communications Corporation (ACCESS Alberta) in 1974. Additional license transfers took place over the years, with CKUA-AM and FM now run as a public radio station by the CKUA Radio Foundation.</p>

</div>


<p>By the mid-1940s, CKUA was funded by groups outside of the university, leaving an opportunity for another radio station to emerge of campus. In 1946, the University of Alberta Student Radio Directorate was formed and built a radio studio, from which it created and sent programming to CKUA. Changing its name to the Alberta Student Radio Society in 1948, this group began to originate campus-only broadcasts via a closed-circuit public address system and eventually shifted to AM carrier current transmissions (under the call letters CKSR for CKUA &#8220;Student Radio&#8221;) to various campus buildings and dorms. An FM cable signal was added in 1976 and the station changed its call letters to CJSR in 1978, as it moved it carrier current frequency to 1580 kHz. When it obtained its FM license in 1983, CJSR turned back its license for its AM carrier current transmissions.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wide Mix of Spoken Word and Music on CJSR Today</h2>



<p>Today, CJSR prides itself on the <a href="https://www.cjsr.com/schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breadth of music and talk programming</a> on its airwaves. Shows range from syndicated news (BBC World Service, Democracy Now) to locally-produced spoken word programs and music shows focused on metal, the history of punk, hardcore, hip-hop, classical, pop, blues, jazz, electronic, Caribbean music, film music, and music from Canada. The environmental news show &#8220;<a href="https://terrainforma.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terra Informa</a>&#8221; is a lauded CJSR program running since 2003, which is now carried by other radio stations. </p>

<p>Rachel, the on-air DJ during my visit, was playing metal, which it turns out is one of the more popular genres at CJSR. Several CJSR shows are geared toward heavy sounds and metal programming is &#8220;hugely popular,&#8221; according to Program Director Chad Brunet. As he pointed to various shows on the schedule, which was craftily posted to his office wall using push pins and rectangular slips of paper, he reflected back on the challenges of the prior three years. Sadly, some long-time programs didn&#8217;t survive the COVID pandemic and the whole experience &#8220;messed up the volunteer make-up,&#8221; after classes and station operations went fully remote.</p>

<p>CJSR was doing all live programming (with the exception of syndicated shows) prior to 2020. A newly acquired automation system was just getting rolled out around that time and it proved useful when they had to evacuate the studios. Eventually programmers began to record shows at home and the station became a &#8220;ghost town.&#8221; Fifty-five percent of the prior schedule was lost and it was &#8220;difficult to maintain enthusiasm.&#8221; Thankfully at the time of my May 2023 visit, CJSR was on an upswing, as things shifted in fall 2022 with an influx of participants again. Students and alumni comprised about 50% of volunteers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CJSR Traditions</h2>



<p>As we wandered about the radio station, it was fun to hear about various CJSR traditions. One is linked to DIY sport coats and another to a shiny sign on the wall. The jackets, an early 2000s CJSR street team uniform, are adorned with the words &#8220;Guerrilla Laser Force&#8221; on the back and &#8220;Rock is Dead&#8221; on the inside. Brunet reluctantly slipped on a coat, saying &#8220;it&#8217;s just awful,&#8221; and that &#8220;we don&#8217;t force people to wear these anymore.&#8221; The outerwear is kept around as a station relic &#8220;for laughs.&#8221; </p>

<p>A long-time tradition that evokes more station pride is a metal CJSR sign in the lobby. Covered with signatures from notable visitors, the inked names include a Canadian astronaut, musician Frank Black, and broadcaster Amy Goodman amongst others.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Archives within the Station Walls at CJSR</h2>



<p>Although Brunet articulated that CJSR wasn&#8217;t that great at capturing its history and archiving materials, the station was full of lovingly preserved items. Projects were underway to digitize CDs and reel-to-reels and one recent find was a 1986 episode of &#8220;Gay Wire,&#8221; a show devoted to LGBTQ issues that was assumed to have debuted later than the tape would suggest. Additionally, the station&#8217;s record library is filled with vinyl records, CDs, and cassettes. </p>

<p>The oldest records have flaking spines, showing the wear-and-tear expected at a decades-old radio station. At last count (over a decade ago), it was estimated that the collection held between 75,000 and 85,000 records. Amongst the vinyl are a range of genres, including &#8220;country AND western,&#8221; plus some uncatalogued records from an old show, &#8220;Chinese Connection&#8221; that left its records behind. Some of the intriguing albums from that program include a worker-themed record with &#8220;Spring Comes Early to the Commune&#8221; on its back cover.</p>

<p>As I wrapped up my tour of CJSR, Gooding and Brunet offered me various promotional items. Tote bags, T-shirts and decals adorned with adorable artwork were hard to pass up. The station also crafts CD compilations and some unique items like branded belt buckets, a wallet, patches, and earplugs. I accepted a few tchotchkes (it&#8217;s always hard to refuse) and said my farewells as I headed back to immerse myself in the SpokenWeb sound studies conference once again.</p>

<p>It was a surreal experience to return to one of my college radio alma maters, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61559574338122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WBGU 88.1 FM</a> at Bowling Green State University (BGSU), and encounter an unrecognizable radio station and campus. Granted it had been nearly 30 years since I&#8217;d left northwest Ohio, but I was still surprised by just how much can change. The building that housed WBGU when I was a grad student <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1066061073494538&amp;ref=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was torn down in 2017</a>. And the historic house built from a Sears catalog kit that was the headquarters of my graduate department (Popular Culture), was <a href="https://searshomes.org/index.php/2012/08/13/in-memoriam-bgsu-popular-culture-house/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demolished in 2012</a>.</p>

<p>Both spaces hold incredible memories for me of an influential two-year period of my life. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever worked harder. I studied, wrote, taught undergraduates, graded papers, DJ&#8217;d, saw tons of live music in Ohio and Michigan, and stayed up into the wee hours tallying WBGU playlists to compile charts for weekly submission to CMJ. It was a magical time where I started to truly understand the importance of and power of college radio. MTV News even came to town and interviewed a few of us college radio participants at a local record shop, as they tried to capture a glimpse of the 1990s indie music scene in small town America.</p>

<p>During my stint as a DJ and assistant music director at WBGU-FM, the station was a 1000 watt music-focused non-commercial station with an emphasis on rock, metal, jazz, and hip-hop. In fall 1995, my first semester at the station, evening shows included hip-hop (&#8220;Power 88&#8221;) several nights a week and metal shows (&#8220;Metal Storm&#8221;) from midnight to 2am most days. Jazz (&#8220;Jazz Unlimited&#8221;), reggae, and country shows populated the morning drive time. The rest of the schedule was a mix of mostly rock, with some shows dedicated to punk, hardcore, freeform, techno, world music, folk, womyn in music, sports talk, and more. Live sports coverage also aired on WBGU, sometimes breaking into scheduled music shows.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, the WBGU-FM space in 120 West Hall (on the first floor) included the on-air studio, news/interview booth, a small record library with vinyl and CDs, and an office area. Adjacent to WBGU was a studio for our sister station WFAL-AM (pronounced &#8220;waffle&#8221;), which was a commercial station broadcasting to the campus dorms using carrier current. My perception at the time was that WBGU functioned like a student club, whereas WFAL had more of a pre-professional orientation. I assumed that WFAL was operated in conjunction with telecommunications classes since WFAL tended to have more news, sports, and mainstream music programming. Digging into the archives, It turns out that some of my assumptions were wrong. WBGU and WFAL both had student leaders. And WFAL&#8217;s programming mix was more diverse than I&#8217;d realized. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">History of College Radio at Bowling Green State University</h2>



<p>While a student at Bowling Green, I was completely unaware of the long radio history on campus. The first radio class (&#8220;Radio Workshop&#8221;) was introduced in 1939 and by 1947, a basketball game was broadcast using a closed-circuit set-up over a public address system. In 1948, campus-only carrier current station <a href="https://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1839&amp;context=bg-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WRSM launched</a> at 600 kilocycles, with help from both students and a speech professor. A 1974 <a href="https://archive.org/details/journalofcollege00unse_13/page/6/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">piece</a> about Bowling Green radio&#8217;s history explains that the call letters were specifically selected by the professor as sort of a voice and diction exercise, as he considered them to be &#8220;a tough combination of sounds&#8221; for many with mid-western accents.</p>

</div>


<p>WRSM&#8217;s schedule included music, news, and sports. In January 1949, just a year after its launch, it had a staff of 75 and a music library with more than 900 records. By 1951, an application was filed for an FM license, with WBGU launching that year over 88.1 FM as initially a 10 watt station. Power was increased to 1350 watts in 1959. By the late 1960s, student leadership at WBGU was replaced by &#8220;three full-time employees and two graduate assistants in broadcasting.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WFAL-AM Launches in 1970 as &#8220;Alternative Voice&#8221;</h2>



<p>Because of this change in management at WBGU, campus-only carrier current station WFAL began broadcasts in 1970 as &#8220;an alternative voice&#8221; for students. While serving as an alternative, it was also designed to be a place where &#8220;broadcasting students&#8221; could obtain experience in &#8220;contemporary, commercial radio.&#8221; WFAL initially played primarily Top 40 and progressive music, with specialty shows devoted to oldies, jazz, and comedy. By the 1980s its focus was more pop/rock. And during the 1990s, the schedule also included <a href="https://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7102&amp;context=bg-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">techno, hip-hop, reggae</a> and more. By 2009, 50% of WFAL&#8217;s schedule was hip-hop programming. <a href="https://bgfalconmedia.com/115334/news/wfal-falcon-radio-enhances-its-station/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WFAL dropped its AM carrier current signal in 2008</a> to broadcast primarily online and eventually stopped using the call letters. The station now goes by the name Falcon Radio.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WBGU-FM&#8217;s Shifts in Programming in the 1970s and 1980s</h2>



<p>Over the years, programming had many shifts on both WBGU and WFAL. In the 1970s, WBGU-FM had more of community-focus, airing National Public Radio programming, while also broadcasting student-oriented rock music at night. By 1976, the station had lost its NPR affiliation and in the 1980s and 1990s the station seemed to have shifted back to alternative programming led by students. In 1982, WBGU&#8217;s program director described the station&#8217;s music mix in a <a href="https://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5054&amp;context=bg-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letter to the editor</a> of the BG News, saying &#8220;WBGU&#8217;s prime goal is to serve the community through its programming of alternative music. This also includes jazz, soul, tex mex, country, reggae, plus more.&#8221; There were still debates about who the station served. A 1985 <a href="https://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5450&amp;context=bg-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letter to editor</a> of the BG News complained that WBGU played music found on commercial radio and was more focused on the community than on students. </p>

<p>By the 1990s, WBGU branded itself as Shark Radio and in addition to its alternative programming, it also produced regular live sports broadcasts. In 1996, WBGU killed off the shark and embraced the mole as its new mascot, describing its kinship with the station&#8217;s programming since moles live &#8220;underground.&#8221; By the early 2000s, WBGU had added a website, which expanded to include not only a webstream, but also a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020808103801/http://wbgufm.org/board/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">message board</a> in 2002, where fans could chat and obtain news about the station. Shifting to a new URL in 2003, the station maintained its own website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060615095336/http://wbgufm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wbgufm.com</a> until fall 2017.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WBGU-FM and Falcon Radio Today</h2>



<p>Today, WBGU-FM and Falcon Radio operate under the umbrella of <a href="https://bgfalconmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bowling Green Falcon Media</a>, which also includes BG News (print and web journalism) and BG 24 (video content). The two radio stations now share a website and are located adjacent to each other in the Michael and Sara Kuhlin Center, which <a href="https://bgfalconmedia.com/127182/news/wbgu-makes-official-move-to-kuhlin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opened in Fall 2016</a>. In addition to on-air studios, the space also has production studios. A recording studio in the same building features a control room that connects to the radio station to enable broadcasts of live performances.</p>

<p>Although there weren&#8217;t too many students around campus when I visited WBGU-FM on a Wednesday evening in July in 2023; I was able to see radio in action as I sat in on my friend&#8217;s show. Rob Sloane, WBGU&#8217;s Music Director, is a faculty member and has been an off-and-on WBGU DJ since the 1990s. We met when we were both grad students/DJs at Bowling Green.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>As I sat with Rob during his show, he played some old favorites, including staples of our time at WBGU in the 1990s. After popping discs from Yo La Tengo, Guided by Voices, Bis, and Stereolab into the CD player, he jotted down his playlist for his personal archive. Multiple times throughout the show, he gave full weather reports and announced events happening in town. It took me back to my WBGU days, when we had to monitor a weather radio in case we needed to announce alerts and warnings for tornadoes in particular. As a California native, I was terrified of thunderstorms and any hint of a tornado; so having to be a calm voice on the radio in those circumstances was challenging.</p>

<p>The current WBGU studio is light-filled, spacious and modern, surrounded by windows. The ground-floor station overlooks the campus one one side, Falcon Radio&#8217;s studio on another, and a hallway with seating on another, allowing visitors to peek into the booth. The lovely view of lush lawns and leafy mature trees felt like it captured not only an iconic collegiate scene, but also a snapshot of a quiet, warm summer night in the mid-west.</p>

</div>


<p>After Rob&#8217;s show, he gave me a quick tour of WBGU outside of the studio. A lobby opens into the studio space, as well as to several small production booths. A sticker-covered door from the old station is propped along the wall of the lobby and a bulletin board is covered with clippings and flyers. Charming children&#8217;s artwork, including a colorful drawing of tulips and music notes, promotes WBGU&#8217;s &#8220;Family Radio&#8221; show. Down the hall, there is also a closet-like record library, with shelves packed with boxes of CDs.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1755RS.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1755RS-1024x683.jpg" alt="Boxes of CDs on shelves at college radio station WBGU-FM.

</div>


<p>Affixed to the wall of the record library is the &#8220;WBGU Vault Indie CD Sign-Out Sheet,&#8221; which DJs are asked to fill out if they are checking out CDs to preview for their shows. While the library contains mostly labeled boxes of CDs, there&#8217;s also a small collection of vinyl. It&#8217;s a greatly reduced library since the station&#8217;s days in West Hall and many of the old CDs were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221194942/http://www.wbgufm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold off for $5 a bag</a> back in 2016 as WBGU was downsizing its collection before the move to the new building.</p>

</div>


<p>With community, faculty and student DJs, the current WBGU-FM schedule includes shows devoted to world music, children&#8217;s programming, jazz, reggae, blues, polka, folk, punk, new music and more. The Bowling Green Chamber of Commerce runs the &#8220;<a href="https://www.bgchamber.net/the-morning-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Morning Show,</a>&#8221; a weekday morning program that highlights local news, events, sports, community members and organizations.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thanks to WBGU + Radio Station Tour Archive</h2>



<p>Thanks so much to my friend Rob Sloane for the WBGU tour and for allowing me to be a fly on the wall during his show. It was so nostalgic for me to be back on campus. This is my 177th radio station tour report and my 119th college radio station recap.

<p>One version of my radio nerd dream vacation includes a cross-country road trip, with numerous stops at college radio stations along the way. With family in tow, it&#8217;s a tough sell; however over the years I&#8217;ve been able to convince them to indulge me in my obsessive quest to tick off more spots on my mental list of must-see radio stations. In summer 2023, with my kid settled in at a summer program in Manhattan, my husband and I sought adventure on the open road, trekking from the Big Apple to Chicago. Of course there were countless college radio stations on our route, but I exhibited restraint and only booked two tours.</p>

<p>Close to the beginning of our journey, we started our day in the Catskills. After a very stormy night, we took a beautiful hike to a waterfall and then wandered about the small town that we were staying in. We poked around a vintage car show, then hit the road to Oneonta to see <a href="https://www.wonyfm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WONY 90.9 FM</a> at the State University of New York, Oneonta, about 80 miles west of Albany. Unsurprisingly, campus was quiet on the Saturday in mid-July that we visited. Just about to head out on vacation himself, WONY faculty adviser Andrew Bottomley happily met up with us to give the grand tour.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WONY&#8217;s New Digs Retain Touches of College Radio Station&#8217;s Past</h2>



<p>An interesting aspect of WONY is that it&#8217;s housed in a relatively new location with the latest audio equipment and technology, yet it retains some of the charm of its most recent long-time home. When Bottomley began working as faculty adviser in 2016, plans were already underway for the station to move. As he got more involved with the process, he took a lot of care to listen to both students and alumni who expressed concerns about losing the visible expressions of the station&#8217;s personality &#8211; from physical media like records and CDs to vintage equipment to sticker-covered doors.</p>

<p>A creative example of this effort is the student-painted dragon mural that greets visitors as they step into WONY. A photographic reproduction of a mural from the wall of the old station, it&#8217;s one way that alumni can feel welcomed back into a familiar-feeling space. Traditionally, alumni sign that wall during station reunion weekends every year; so the new wallpaper-style mural allows for both new and old autographs to remain. The dragon is a nod to the Red Dragon mascot for SUNY Oneonta; however that mascot is not used exclusively at WONY, which also added a cute blue whale (Wally) as a station mascot perhaps a decade or so ago.</p>

<p>With a 60+ year history dating back to 1961, WONY has an active and engaged crew of alums, many of whom had &#8220;trepidation&#8221; about the latest station move. Bottomley said that those fears have largely dissipated, in part because former station members can see things at the new WONY that &#8220;connect to the old space,&#8221; including a decades-old console displayed on a wall next to award plaques and framed certificates.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Physical Music is Prioritized in WONY&#8217;s Revamped CD Library</h2>



<p>Additionally, as part of an independent study project, a student organized and cataloged the WONY CD library in a way that both shows pride in the collection; but that also makes it easier for DJs to access and utilize the discs. With around 10,000 CDs from mostly the late 1980s to around 2004, WONY&#8217;s music library was in the process of being digitized at the time of my visit. Bottomley was pleased that with a CD revival happening, many students at WONY are &#8220;starting to discover CDs in the way that students were discovering vinyl in the past.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not much vinyl is left at WONY following a mysterious vinyl sell-off circa 2008, which was rumored to have financed the purchase of a conference table. That series of events angered alumni and as a result Bottomley wanted to protect the CDs and ensure that the sense of betrayal that many felt regarding the lost vinyl would not be repeated. He said that alumni would get teary-eyed as they spoke about the records that were disposed of and remarked that, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to let that happen to the CD library.&#8221;</p>

<p>Completed during the height of COVID in the 2020-2021 academic year, the current home for WONY is centrally located in the basement of Hunt Union, next to a theater. The station space includes two broadcast studios, two podcast booths, a production office and an administration office. Now in its 4th location on campus, WONY&#8217;s previous digs were in Alumni Hall, which was slated for renovation. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WONY History: 1962 Launch as AM Carrier Current Station</h2>



<p>Launching as an AM carrier current station (at 620 AM) in 1962, by the late 1960s, WONY had added an FM signal through a partnership with the local cable television network. Bottomley told me that this was one of the first cable television networks in the United States and WONY&#8217;s inclusion on it made it one of the early college radio participants. This expanded the station&#8217;s reach to the town of Oneonta, as residents could tune in through video cable at 93.6 FM when it launched in March 1968 and later on a series of other spots on the dial, including <a href="https://archive.org/details/collegeradiodece00unse/mode/2up?q=WONY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">89.0 in December 1968</a> and at <a href="https://archive.org/details/journalofcollege00unse_29/page/6/mode/2up?q=WONY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">106.3 in 1972</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cable FM and Expanded Programming for WONY in Early 1970s</h2>



<p>During this period, WONY&#8217;s General Manager Roger Smith worked to get more attention for the station, writing to IBS&#8217; <em>Journal of College Radio</em> imploring the publication to highlight smaller stations in its &#8220;Station of the Month&#8221; feature. In his <a href="https://archive.org/details/journalofcollege00unse_49/page/2/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 1971 pitch</a> for WONY (published as a &#8220;letter to the editor&#8221;), Smith asks, &#8220;What about the little guy who might be running a pretty good ship, without anyone being paid, operating on a minimal budget, without speech department backing or even the active help of an advisor? He rarely receives recognition or even a pat on the back from <em>The Journal</em>.&#8221; He goes on to describe WONY as &#8220;just a small, average college radio station&#8221; and included photos and details about WONY&#8217;s operations that were published as a stand-alone article titled &#8220;<a href="https://archive.org/details/journalofcollege00unse_49/page/8/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bigger and Better</a>&#8221; in the same issue. The station had expanded into new studios the year before and WONY was on the air with live programs 21 hours a day. Some highlights of the station&#8217;s programming in 1971 included remote basketball game broadcasts and a weekly coffee house show.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WONY-FM Launches in 1976</h2>



<p>Although the 1971 <em>Journal of College Radio</em> article didn&#8217;t include mention of WONY&#8217;s cable FM endeavors, a few months later in its <a href="https://archive.org/details/journalofcollege00unse_29/page/2/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 1972 issue</a>, the publication reported on this as a trend in broadcasting. The piece describes cable FM as a &#8220;new method of college broadcasting&#8221; that had been &#8220;growing substantially in the last few years.&#8221; They cited seven known stations in operation, including WONY, which was on cable FM through at least 1974. Within a few years, WONY&#8217;s reach expanded even further after it acquired an FM license from the FCC. In 1976, WONY-FM officially launched over 90.9 FM with 10 watts of power. Eventually, the station&#8217;s power increased to its current 180 watts over the same frequency.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WONY Programming and Events in 2025</h2>



<p>A student-operated and student-funded organization, WONY is active both on and off the air. To participate in station activities, one must be either a SUNY Oneonta student or faculty member. The station airs both music and talk shows, including some shows that blend the two, like Ball &amp; Beats, which is described on the schedule as &#8220;a show about sports and other fun topics while listening to Hip-Hop hits.&#8221; On Saturday nights, &#8220;What&#8217;s for Dinner&#8221; is a show &#8220;dedicated to thinking about, talking about, and planning what&#8217;s for dinner,&#8221; with each episode tackling &#8220;a new food topic&#8221; while also playing music. Other programs focus on alternative rock, music from vinyl records, 1970s-1990s music, pop, indie, and &#8220;themed music&#8221; (a recent edition was about music from the British Invasion).</p>

<p>Additionally, all members and DJs at WONY are required to join a station department (music, production, PR or events). Each year, WONY puts on two big concert events: HalloWONY in the fall and WONY Island in the spring. The most recent WONY Island was a Sunday afternoon show featuring 10 local bands playing sets in the Fine Arts building on April 6, 2025. The station will also participate in <a href="https://www.vinylthon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vinylthon</a> this year, playing 24 hours of music from vinyl records starting on April 12 at 8pm.</p>

<p>On a Sunday morning, when most college students were likely asleep, <a href="https://kucr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KUCR</a> Music Director Diya Anantharaman cheerfully greeted me at <a href="https://www.ucr.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">University of California, Riverside&#8217;s</a> college radio station. Off-the-beaten path, KUCR 88.3 FM occupies a couple of low-slung aging buildings that are adjacent to residence halls and apartments near the northern edge of campus. </p>

<p>A visit to KUCR is like a step back in time (in the best possible way), with tidbits of station history dotting the walls and studios. Vintage embossed labels meticulously describe the location and functionality of decades-old audio equipment and retro signage communicates station rules as well as what&#8217;s behind various office doors (including &#8220;restroom/storage&#8221;). While these indicators of KUCR&#8217;s long run as a station (broadcasts began from this very building in 1966) ooze with nostalgic charm; the station continues to have a vibrant presence in 2025.</p>

<p>Third year student Anantharaman was so enthusiastic about college radio, that they applied to be at KUCR before even starting school at UC Riverside. Having made playlists since high school, they began as a KUCR DJ as a first-year student and took on the role of music director as a sophomore. Describing KUCR is &#8220;one of my favorite places to be,&#8221; Anantharaman added that a benefit of the &#8220;very welcoming&#8221; college radio station is that it serves as an &#8220;art space&#8221; on campus.</p>

A sign on the door reads &quot;Music Department&quot; and there are stickers all over the door, including one for Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings. Photo: J.

</div>


<p>As one might expect from a college radio music director, Anantharaman&#8217;s own show is quite experimental and often features artist interviews and a mix of poetry, electronic music, harsh noise, metal, Bollywood music, and much more. They said that sometimes the weather influences their playlist, with one goal of the show to be &#8220;perceptive&#8221; to what&#8217;s going on around them.</p>

<p>Anantharaman characterized most DJs at KUCR as being diverse in terms of their music selections and said that there aren&#8217;t too many restrictions as far as what you can and cannot do on your show. Hosts include students, alumni, and even some UC Riverside professors. While most of KUCR&#8217;s new music adds are digital, they also add some CDs and the station&#8217;s library includes a portion of their vinyl library. A mail tub of FCC-friendly CDs sits in the main studio, in close reach in case of technology emergencies during which DJs might not have access to the mostly-played digital music files.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Snapshot of College Radio Station KUCR&#8217;s Early Days</h2>



<p>KUCR&#8217;s emphasis on diversity in music and news was in place from the very beginning. The station&#8217;s original <a href="https://kucr.org/pics/A.90.a%20Original%20script%20KUCR%20sign-on%20and%20dedication%2023%20September%201966_resized.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sign-on script</a> when it launched on 88.1 FM in October 1966 reads in part that KUCR planned to &#8220;present a wide variety of music,&#8221; with a particular focus on music &#8220;geared to the college community&#8221; and &#8220;which is not readily available from other local radio stations.&#8221; </p>

<p>KUCR alumnus and former station manager <a href="https://kucr.org/wp-content/uploads/KUCR-history-with-photos1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bob Stubenrauch&#8217;s remembrances</a> of the early years of the college radio station offer a fascinating glimpse at how quickly students were able to ramp up their operations and reach listeners across the country during the Vietnam War. By the 1968-1969 academic year, KUCR was on the air 24 hours a day and had a staff of 120, with 75 on-air DJs. The station was also part of the UC Radio News Network, which &#8220;bloomed in the 68-69 year as student unrest &amp; protests continued to spread &amp; grow,&#8221; according to Stubenrauch. He explains that the network began doing a combined news show three times a week featuring content from various University of California-based student radio stations. This eventually led to the production of daily live reports from throughout the network, as the pace of demonstrations and protests increased on all the campuses.</p>

</div>


<p>By 1970, KUCR was regularly sharing and receiving campus news and protest coverage with college radio stations from all over the United States. According to Stubenrauch, &#8220;&#8230;we began calling college radio stations all over the nation, asking them to tell us what was going on at their schools. We became a primary news gathering &amp; dissemination source for campus radio stations all over the country. Harvard, Yale, New York University, University of Chicago &amp; many other were onboard to give &amp; receive news clips to &amp; from KUCR.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">KUCR Schedule Offers a Mix of Radio Programming</h2>



<p>As was the case in its early days, the current KUCR schedule features a broad mix of news and music programming. Locally-produced and syndicated news and public affairs shows airing on KUCR include &#8220;Children&#8217;s Hour,&#8221; &#8220;Autotalk,&#8221; &#8220;Philosophy Talk,&#8221; &#8220;Big Picture Science,&#8221; &#8220;Alternative Radio&#8221; and more. A long-time highlight of the schedule is <a href="https://csp.ucr.edu/events/radio-aztlan-streaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radio Aztlan</a>, a Chicano/Latino alternative program that has been on the air for 35+ years and features a mix of music, interviews, and a community calendar.</p>

</div>


<p>KUCR&#8217;s music shows cover a range of genres including jazz, reggae, folk, classical, R&amp;B, soul, rock, electronic, blues, and more. Whimsical names like &#8220;Sonic Bloom,&#8221; &#8220;Vibe Check,&#8221; &#8220;Outsider Roundup,&#8221; &#8220;Radio Prosthesis,&#8221; &#8220;Musick 4 Riots&#8221; and &#8220;Hippie Love Turbo&#8221; hint at the often hard-to-pin-down mix of sounds. </p>

<p>A recent <a href="https://kucr.org/2025/02/11/biodigital-dreams-w-dj-amos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promotional flyer</a> for DJ Amos Figueroa&#8217;s Monday afternoon show &#8220;Biodigital Dreams&#8221; is indicative of that music breadth. The show &#8220;features 90&#8217;s and 2000&#8217;s music that evokes feelings of nostalgia and sentimentality.&#8221;  While it&#8217;s not uncommon for DJs to create artwork to promote their radio shows, it was nice to see that KUCR also makes an effort to publicize their DJs. During my tour around KUCR in early February 2025, one of the first things to catch my eye were clippings from the school newspaper, The Highlander, featuring profiles of KUCR DJs, that were ads run by the station.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Promoting KUCR + An Extra Special Leo Blais Sign</h2>



<p>In addition to getting the word out about KUCR through the UC Riverside newspaper, the station also regularly tables on campus, provides DJs for local events, collaborated with local music festival Mucho Gusto, and recently hosted a karaoke night. I was also glad to see that KUCR was on the radar of musician Leo Blais, who sent the station TWO copies of personalized KUCR signs. </p>

<p>While I&#8217;ve seen his creations in college radio stations from coast to coast, this is the first time that I&#8217;ve spotted an identical duo of <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2015/06/solving-the-mystery-of-the-ubiquitous-radio-station-call-letter-signs-the-leo-blais-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leo Blais signs</a> in one station. One is perched next to a teddy bear high on a shelf in KUCR&#8217;s lobby, while another sits in the KUCR interview room stacked on top of a receiver and CD player.</p>

<p>What are the best college radio stations? That&#8217;s an impossible question to answer, but each year Princeton Review publishes a list based on student surveys about station &#8220;popularity&#8221; taken at hundreds of college campuses. I&#8217;ve been monitoring these lists for nearly 20 years and am always intrigued by how the collection of schools shuffles from year to year. Back in August 2024, Princeton Review released its latest college guide, <a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/best-colleges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best 390 Colleges</a> &#8211; 2025 edition, which include its rankings for “<a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/?rankings=best-college-radio-station" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best College Radio Station</a>.” </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">University of South Florida is #1, Yet Has No Student Radio Station</h2>



<p>Notably, the number one, &#8220;most popular&#8221; college radio station according to Princeton Review, is the one at University of South Florida, which appears to no longer have a student radio station. However, the campus is home to public radio station WUSF, which perhaps is why the school&#8217;s station garners such recognition from students. University of South Florida&#8217;s former college radio station, Bulls Radio, launched in 1988 and used to broadcast on campus over AM, as well as on an HD channel and online. Although Bulls Radio is described on the <a href="https://www.asgaonline.com/asga/campus-media/university-of-south-floridatampa-usf-bulls-radio-3821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">school student government&#8217;s website</a> as having a &#8220;constant stream of unique programming,&#8221; <a href="https://tunein.com/radio/Bulls-Radio-897-s230635/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the stream</a> is no longer available on Tune In and a Wikipedia entry indicates that &#8220;in 2019 Bulls Radio was rebranded to Bulls Media.&#8221; The Bulls Media website has details about numerous services, including podcasting studios and production facilities, but no mention of a radio station. Regardless, University of South Florida has topped the Princeton Review&#8217;s most popular college radio station list in 2025 and 2024, was #2 on the 2023 list, and #1 on the 2021 list (released in August 2020). The first time that I saw the school hit the list was on the 2020 list, where it placed at #3. Curiously, that list was released in August 2019, just as the station was likely closing up shop.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">East Coast Dominates</h2>



<p>Once again, the Princeton Review list is a mix, including large universities with multiple radio stations as well as small liberal arts colleges with online-only stations. The biggest school on the list is Arizona State (with 183,000+ students) and the tiniest is Bennington College (797 undergraduates). I am also pleased to have visited college radio stations at 6 out of the 25 schools on the list.</p>



<p>The East Coast still dominates, although there&#8217;s a growing proportion of the list from the midwest and the western part of Pennsylvania. The south and southwest are barely present, with huge states like California and Texas not represented at all. The breakdown is as follows: 15 from the northeast (4 from New York, 3 from New Jersey, 3 from Massachusetts, 2 from Vermont, 2 from Pennsylvania, and 1 from Maine). From the Midwest, the 5 schools hail from Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Michigan, and Ohio. On the west coast, only 3 schools are represented (2 from Washington and 1 from Oregon). The sole school from the South is in Florida. And the only college from the Southwest is in Arizona.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best = Popular</h2>



<p>As a reminder, although the Princeton Review describes its college radio results as “Best College Radio Station,” the title doesn’t tell the whole story. Here’s the scoop:</p>



<p>1. Results are based on student surveys</p>



<p>2. Surveys were conducted at 390 colleges</p>



<p>3. Students are asked to <strong>judge the popularity</strong>, not the quality, of an unspecified campus radio station <strong>at their own college</strong></p>



<p>4. Radio stations are not named in the survey or in the resulting rankings</p>



<p>5. Only schools surveyed can make it into the rankings, so college radio stations at schools that are not surveyed by Princeton Review won’t appear on the list</p>



<p>A number of colleges appearing on the “Best College Radio Station” list have multiple radio stations, including student-run stations, large public radio stations, and everything in between. It makes sense that students would indicate that their school’s radio station is “popular” if they are on a campus with a high profile professional radio station and/or with several radio stations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Digging into Methodology</h2>



<p>According to Princeton Review, &#8220;We tallied the rankings lists in the current edition of&nbsp;The Best&nbsp;390 Colleges (published August 2024) based on the data from our surveys of 168,000 students at the&nbsp;390 schools in the book.&#8221;</p>



<p>The site says that the “Best College Radio Station” list is compiled “based on students’ answers to the survey question, ‘How popular is the college radio station?,” but in recent years, the question was phrased a little differently. For the 2021 edition’s list, the survey asked, “<em>How much do you agree or disagree with the following statements at your school?” </em>Among the list of statements was: <em>“College Radio Station is popular.” </em>Respondents were given the following options:<em> Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neither Agree or Disagree, Agree or Strongly Agree.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1501699323692_37177">How Similar is this Year’s List to Prior Lists?</h2>



<p>For the 2025 Princeton Review list of “Best College Radio Stations,” 20 of the 25 schools were on the 2024 list. <strong>Illinois Institute of Technology</strong> and <strong>Allegheny College</strong> are brand new entrants, not having appeared during the 17+ years that I’ve been tracking Princeton Review lists. The other three schools that did not appear last year include Carleton College (last appeared on 2023 list), Saint Michael&#8217;s College (last appeared on 2022 list) and DePauw University (last appeared on 2022 list).</p>



<p>Those that fell off the list this year were Macalester College, Sarah Lawrence College, Fordham University, Roanoke College, and Providence College. </p>



<p>The complete list for the 2025 edition is listed below.

<p>Thanksgiving 2024 is a bit sadder this year, with the news that Alice Brock has passed away. What a cruel irony that the woman who inspired the Thanksgiving-themed Arlo Guthrie folk song &#8220;Alice&#8217;s Restaurant,&#8221; departed just a week before radio stations across the land would be broadcasting the story-song inspired by and named after her.</p>



<p>I feel so lucky to have been able to chat with Alice Brock back in 2020 on the <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2024/11/podcast-remembering-alice-brock-of-alices-restaurant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radio Survivor podcast, which we have presented again this year in her honor</a>. This <a href="https://www.alicebrockstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alice Brock</a> episode is recommended listening, especially in 2024, as it provides perspective on how Guthrie’s song came to be and why it has resonated with so many people.</p>



<p>Although I&#8217;ve been compiling lists of where to listen to &#8220;Alice&#8217;s Restaurant&#8221; on the radio pretty much every year since 2010, the lists are never complete and chances are that most folks will need to do their own sleuthing in order to ascertain where to tune in to hear the classic.</p>



<p>In lieu of a listening guide this year, I offer up tips on how to find out if your hometown station is playing &#8220;Alice&#8217;s Restaurant.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to find &#8220;Alice&#8217;s Restaurant&#8221; on the radio in 2024</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Consult the <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2023/11/alices-restaurant-on-the-radio-thanksgiving-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023 Radio Survivor &#8220;Alice&#8217;s Restaurant&#8221; listening guide</a> to get a sense of stations likely to play the song in your area</li>



<li>Check the social media accounts and websites of stations that tend to play &#8220;Alice&#8217;s Restaurant&#8221; for posts about air times (In past years, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have been helpful resources)</li>



<li>If you are at a loss for station ideas, focus on commercial classic rock stations, public radio stations, and folk/country-oriented specialty shows on college and community radio stations</li>



<li>To dig even deeper, look through <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/tag/alices-restaurant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous Radio Survivor listening guides</a> (which date back to 2010!) to get clues about the array of stations broadcasting the song annually</li>
</ul>



<p>Have a wonderful 2024 Thanksgiving celebration!</p>

<p>Several years ago, Radio Survivor had the pleasure of speaking with artist and restaurateur Alice Brock, the woman who provided much inspiration for Arlo Guthrie’s inadvertent Thanksgiving Day radio staple, “Alice’s Restaurant.” Sadly, Alice Brock passed away on November 21, 2024 at the age of 83, just a week before the classic rock radio airwaves will be blanketed with the song that made her famous.</p>



<p>This year, in honor of Alice, we are presenting the Radio Survivor episode that we recorded with her in advance of Thanksgiving 2020, which was the most unusual of holidays, as the COVID-19 pandemic kept many of us separated from friends and family. During our discussion, Alice Brock shares with us not only some insight into the 18-minute anti-war epic &#8220;Alice&#8217;s Restaurant&#8221;; but also stories about her life and holiday traditions. For 2020, Brock was inspired to create a special introductory message for radio stations to play in advance of “Alice’s Restaurant,” and she explains why she was moved to offer up these words of thanks during that pandemic year in particular.</p>



<p>As we approach another holiday, our thoughts go out to Alice Brock&#8217;s friends and family. We are so grateful to have had the chance to chat with Alice and share Thanksgiving 2020 with her through the magic of podcasting.</p>

<p>As we chatted over lunch in the dining hall at Bowdoin College on a late August afternoon, Mason Daugherty, one of the Station Managers of college radio station <a href="https://wbor.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WBOR-FM</a>, said quick &#8220;hellos&#8221; to friends who he hadn&#8217;t seen in months. The verdant campus in Brunswick, Maine was coming to life, as students were beginning to arrive for orientation training and athletic activities. Daugherty had been there all summer, working at a job nearby and tending to the radio station at the small liberal arts college. Time was of the essence for my visit, as this fall is WBOR&#8217;s final semester in its home in the Dudley Coe basement.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WBOR&#8217;s Cozy Basement Home in Dudley Coe</h2>



<p>Tucked away in the back of Dudley Coe, WBOR is accessed by descending a short set of concrete steps. As the front door opens, a soft glow emanates from a variety of sources, including string lighting, a shaded swing arm lamp, a pink neon sign, audio equipment, and a red, yellow, and green traffic light perched on a shelf. The typical college-issued harsh overhead fluorescent bulbs have been turned off and the subdued lighting sets the tone as both an inviting and relaxing space. A lounge area is outfitted with comfy chairs, an area rug, coffee table, and customized throw pillows with a cassette tape-themed WBOR logo.</p>

<p>The station walls are covered with posters, flyers, stickers, and handwritten notes and drawings from DJs past and present. While some of these musings were clearly scribbled for shock value (&#8220;I love boobs&#8221;), others hint at the intellectual pursuits of their authors. From existential crises (&#8220;You can send me to college, but you can&#8217;t make me think&#8221;) to short stories-in-the-making (&#8220;I feel like my mom doing heroin in the 90s&#8221;), to bittersweet love notes memorializing Bowdoin and WBOR (&#8220;Goodbye WBOR I mean Dudley Coe the only non sterile space on campus here&#8217;s to everything that has disappeared but meant everything at a time&#8221;); the prose on all the station spaces would take hours to fully document.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Music and Ephemera at WBOR</h2>



<p>Decorative beads hang from a doorway that leads from the lounge into a room bordered by music. Vinyl records and CDs are stashed in shelves and drawers throughout the station, while fake flowers, plastic figurines, a lava lap, and other ephemera add to the funky atmosphere. There’s an Apples in Stereo painting by prolific artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/steve.keene/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve Keene</a> (a <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/tag/steve-keene-painting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">college radio staple</a>!) in one of the studios and a metal cabinet in the bathroom is like a 1990s (and earlier) time capsule, covered with a faded Del Rubio Triplets album cover and stickers from Buffalo Daughter, Komeda, Superchunk, Spiritualized and other bands of the era.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Modern Technology in the College Radio Station Studio</h2>



<p>The large broadcast studio has a vintage “on-air” light hanging over the entrance and I was told by Mason that it is an antique from the station’s early days. Inside the studio are modern additions, including an interface that Mason had designed, allowing DJs to easily play through a series of station announcements. Computer monitors display station information, text messages from listeners, and playlist details. An LED sign perched behind the mixing board shows the date and time, but can also be configured to show details from EAS tests and alerts.&nbsp;While doing their live programs from this studio, DJs can play music from turntables, CD players and digital sources.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Evidence of the Past in Funky WBOR Space</h2>



<p>Adding to the funkiness of the WBOR space is the building&#8217;s back story. Dudley Coe used to be the home of the Bowdoin infirmary and there are still remnants and reminders of those days, including a metal circuit breaker box with the word X-Ray stenciled on it in black ink. Apparently there’s also dumb waiter running through the building and claw foot bathtubs. Most of the organizations that were more recently housed in Dudley Coe have moved out, leaving WBOR alone in the basement.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<p>Books and other items from the long-gone print shop are scattered throughout the adjoining rooms, alongside dust and cobwebs. When leaving the coziness of WBOR&#8217;s corner of the basement, the unoccupied rooms feel creepy in comparison and lend credence to rumors that the building is haunted. In spite of that, a handful of professors are using the upstairs rooms as temporary offices before the building gets demolished.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WBOR&#8217;s Impending Move</h2>



<p>When January comes, the station’s operations are scheduled to be moved across campus to Coles Tower, once the tallest building in Maine. WBOR’s antenna is already atop the 16-story residence hall. The new first-floor space is radically smaller than the existing WBOR digs. Carved out of a former TV studio (which also operated as an interview room) the new WBOR will have only a few distinct rooms. A long entryway leads to an open area with wooden shelving for vinyl records on one wall and there&#8217;s already a copy of the 12&#8243; of Prince and the Revolution&#8217;s &#8220;Another Lonely Christmas&#8221; sitting on the largely empty shelf. A window and doorway occupy the opposite wall, which leads to the studio. There are also a few small nooks, but the full layout is very much TBD. Mason anticipated not bringing much from the old space, telling me that they would likely digitize the CDs and then store them off-site.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Work to Save Radio History and Capture WBOR&#8217;s Past and Present</h2>



<p>In anticipation of the move, WBOR has already started bringing historical items, like paperwork, zines, program guides, and posters, to Bowdoin College’s Special Collections so that this material will be preserved. The challenge, as Mason pointed out, is documenting everything scrawled on the walls and ceilings throughout WBOR. One idea is to do a 3D capture, so that people could potential walk through the station virtually in the future. Some short videos have already been shot, including a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@usatreasury/video/7032489882614369583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok shot by Mason</a> that went viral, garnering over a million views.</p>

<p>While I&#8217;m saddened by WBOR&#8217;s impending move, it&#8217;s encouraging that WBOR and Bowdoin College are working to save station materials. This was apparent to me during my visit to the library&#8217;s <a href="https://library.bowdoin.edu/arch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Special Collections and Archives</a>, where I spent an afternoon combing through boxes and files full of radio station-related goodies. Carefully stored in archival boxes were WBOR &#8216;zines, playlists, DJ log books, posters, manuals, memos, FCC paperwork, stickers, flyers, reels, carts, and more &#8212; all capturing a history dating back to the 1950s for WBOR and back to the 1940s for broadcast radio activities on campus.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Storied History of College Radio at Bowdoin</h2>



<p>Originally, students and faculty led radio projects under the banner of BOTA, for Bowdoin on the Air. While productions were recorded on campus, the broadcasts aired on other local stations. By 1950, Bowdoin was testing out its own AM signal, officially launching WBOA (for &#8220;Bowdoin-on-air&#8221;) in May, 1951 over 820 AM. A few months before launch, WBOA sent delegates to a <a href="https://bwarchive.lib.lehigh.edu/?a=d&amp;d=BW19510313-01.2.13&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regional college radio conference</a> hosted <a href="https://thesophian.com/see-you-next-week-here-at-wozq-91-9-fm-a-history-of-smith-student-radio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the Smith College Radio station</a> WCSR. This event brought together station representatives from the east coast and was a sign of the growing number of collaborative endeavors by college radio stations in the 1940s and 1950s.</p>

<p>An FM frequency was added in 1956 and that marks the beginning of WBOR (for &#8220;Bowdoin-on-radio&#8221;) 91.1 FM. According to WBOR&#8217;s <a href="https://wbor.org/#timeline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">history timeline</a>, &#8220;Most Bowdoin students didn&#8217;t own an FM radios during this period, so station management built and installed illegal Heathkit FM tuners and miniature AM transmitters in each campus dorm and fraternity house. The station transmitted on 640 kHz, which was then a CONELRAD frequency (used to broadcast emergency warning information in the event of a nuclear attack on the US).&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WBOR in 2024: Active and Thriving Radio Station</h2>



<p>Today, WBOR is a very active group at Bowdoin, with around 200 participants, which is more than 10% of the student body. During the academic year, the makeup of WBOR is around 85% students, with community members (including faculty and staff &#8211; even deans!) comprising the remainder. The station has a freeform programming philosophy and it’s possible to tune in and hear shows that play wildly different music genres back to back. Some of the programs in spring 2024 included “Unspoken Guitar Heroes,” “Pink Finger: Riot Grrl Radio,” Your Dad’s CDs,” “PopRocks,” “La Bruja Azul,” “Coastal Classical,” “If It Sounds Country, That’s What it Is,” and more. Other shows were devoted to The Pixies, jazz, and other more esoteric themes, including one that sought inspiration from <a href="https://playlists.wbor.org/WBOR/pl/18908211/Prison-Rodeo?layout=1">an episode of the Simpsons</a>.</p>

<p>Getting ready to begin senior year, Mason remained upbeat about the station’s move, reasoning that it would be impossible to take everything with them, while also pointing out some of the benefits of the new space, including greater accessibility (no stairs) and more windows. Less hidden from view, it will be located in a building that houses dorm rooms and meeting spaces.</p>

<p>We travel back to the 1980s, when the show, <em>The Famous Computer Cafe</em>, initially launched over the radio in southern California. With a focus on home computers, computer news, and more, the program had a fascinating roster of guests, including Timothy Leary, Donny Osmond, Bill Gates, and so many others. Although it was assumed that all the recordings of the show were lost; recently 53 episodes were found and digitized. Computer historian and archivist Kay Savetz spearheaded this project and joins us on Radio Survivor, alongside one of the creators and hosts of <em>The Famous Computer Cafe</em>, Ellen Fields.</p>

<p>Williams College student Josh Picoult arrived on campus with a fascination for both history and radio. Four years later, he&#8217;s about to graduate after completing his undergraduate thesis on the history of college radio station WCFM, where he&#8217;s also the general manager. On this edition of Radio Survivor, we are joined by Josh, who talks us through some of the big ideas from his thesis: <em>Gas Pipes, Gigahertz, and Grunge: Broadcasting at Williams College, 1940-1998</em>. Josh also shares details about the current state of radio on campus.</p>

<p>In the last few years YouTube has become one of the most popular platforms for consuming podcasts, even though it&#8217;s a primarily a video platform, and podcasts have traditionally been an audio-first medium. This fact has raised both questions and concerns with podcasters. Paul has worked on research studies intended to better understand why and how people use YouTube to consume podcasts. He shares that data along with analyses and thoughts on how podcasters might think about YouTube and video.</p>

<p>The Radio Survivor team returns for a new episode, during which Jennifer, Eric and Paul recap some of the latest radio news. Topics this week including LPFM, college radio history, radio documentaries, expanding and returning radio stations, and a slow radio broadcast for Earth Day.</p>



<p>Jennifer talks about her new gig working on a college radio history collection that is part of the Digital Library of Amateur Radio and Communications (DLARC) on the Internet Archive. </p>



<p>Additionally, we cover some updates to the radio landscape, including details about the most recent low-power FM licensing window, during which 388 groups (and counting) have been awarded construction permits for new LPFM stations. In San Francisco, streaming radio station BFF.fm is the recipient of one of these coveted spots on the dial. </p>



<p>Also coming to the San Francisco airwaves is Seattle-based non-commercial radio station KEXP, which acquired the former KREV full-power FM commercial frequency in a bankruptcy auction. Across the country in New York City, streaming community radio station East Village Radio is returning after it ceased operations nearly a decade ago.</p>



<p>A few radio stories are coming to the big screen. <em>35,000 Watts</em>, a documentary about college radio, has made its debut and is initially hitting the college radio circuit. Jennifer will be in attendance at a <em>35,000 Watts</em> screening and panel discussion at Pomona College on March 28th as part of a fundraising event for college radio station KSPC. Another radio film in the works, <em>40 Watts to Nowhere</em>, recounts the story of pirate radio station KBLT, which ran out of founder Sue Carpenter&#8217;s home in Silver Lake near Los Angeles in the late 1990s.</p>



<p>Finally, we alert stations to an opportunity to participate in the annual Earth Day radio event: Wetland Project Slow Radio Broadcast on April 22, 2024. Stations can air all or part of the 24-hour broadcast featuring the sounds of nature, including birds, frogs, insects, and airplanes.</p>

<p>On this edition of the show, we explore public radio history, specifically the origins of public radio in the United States, including the important role played by college and university-based stations. Josh Shepperd joins to talk about his new book, <em>Shadow of the New Deal: The Victory of Public Broadcasting</em>, which examines the intersections between the media reform movement, public broadcasting, educational technology and communications policy and research. Josh is an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder and is Director of the Radio Preservation Task Force at the Library of Congress<strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p>Arlo Guthrie’s seasonally appropriate “Alice’s Restaurant” is getting dusted off once again for radio airplay this Thanksgiving 2023. </p>



<p>I’ve been documenting this radio ritual for many years (even while suffering with COVID last year) and was pleased to be able <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2020/11/podcast-273-thanksgiving-and-radio-traditions-with-alice-brock-of-alices-restaurant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to speak to THE Alice in 2020</a>. Our <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2020/11/podcast-273-thanksgiving-and-radio-traditions-with-alice-brock-of-alices-restaurant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radio Survivor conversation</a> with <a href="https://www.alicebrockstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alice Brock</a> is recommended listening, as it provides perspective on how Guthrie’s song came to be and why it has resonated with so many people.</p>



<p>This year, I was amused to see that there&#8217;s a podcast, <a href="https://www.1089thehawk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">108.9 The Hawk</a>, about a fictional classic rock radio station. Apparently in prior years they have done episodes about the rock station staple, &#8220;Alice&#8217;s Restaurant,&#8221; and for 2023 they have produced a mega episode. They <a href="https://www.1089thehawk.com/the-alice-saga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write</a>, &#8220;Well, now for the very first time, experience BOTH specials &#8211; &#8216;Alice&#8217;s Restaurant Attacks!&#8217; and &#8216;Alice&#8217;s Revenge&#8217; combined into one blood curdling, spine chilling, family dinner ruining episode!&#8221; Sounds intriguing.</p>



<p>Have a wonderful 2023 Thanksgiving celebration! If catching &#8220;Alice&#8217;s Restaurant&#8221; is part of your holiday tradition, read on for my guide to listening options on your radio dial for 2023. </p>



<p>As always, this is an incomplete list. DO double check with your local stations to be sure that times have not shifted. Additionally, I am only including stations for which I have verified that they will be airing &#8220;Alice&#8217;s Restaurant&#8221; for 2023. However, you may want to consult my <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/tag/alices-restaurant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prior radio guides</a> to identify other radio stations that tend to play the song annually.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pre-Thanksgiving Servings of &#8220;Alice&#8217;s Restaurant&#8221; on the Radio in 2023</h2>



<p>&#8220;Alice&#8217;s Restaurant&#8221; is also airing before Thanksgiving on some stations. On Monday, November 20, <a href="https://www.wdiy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WDIY 88.1 FM</a> (Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania) airs &#8220;Alice&#8217;s Restaurant&#8221; between 7 and 9pm on Steve Aaronson&#8217;s &#8220;Folk Classics&#8221; show, which features a Thanksgiving theme. Additionally, on Tuesday, November 21, &#8220;Alice&#8217;s Restaurant&#8221; airs on <a href="http://www.wesufm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WESU 88.1 FM</a> (Middletown, CT) at around 7pm during the Acoustic Blender show.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, November 22, Angelica Community Radio <a href="http://wraq.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WRAQ 92.7 FM</a> (Angelica, NY) broadcasts it at 9am and <a href="https://1059themountain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WTMT-FM 105.9 The Mountain</a> (Asheville, North Carolina) will air it at 6pm. </p>

<p>The phrase &#8220;The neighbors complain,&#8221; circles around what appears to be a black WPIR pirate flag. This imagery on the <a href="https://wpirprattradio.cargo.site/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website for college radio station WPIR Pratt Radio</a> alludes to rumors and half-truths about student radio&#8217;s legacy and mysterious history on the Brooklyn, New York campus of the Pratt Institute. As is the case at many college radio stations, the concept of history is largely focused on the past few years. And with the COVID disruption, even that institutional memory has mostly been erased.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WPIR Pratt Radio in 2023</h2>



<p>However, the 2022-2023 academic year shaped up to be a pivotal moment, with in-person classes happening once again and mask mandates loosening. After a few shaky years, WPIR Pratt Radio is back in action, broadcasting online from a spiffy new studio (as of February, 2023) in the recently renovated Chapel Hall. In spring, 2023, WPIR had 28 shows airing on its internet stream, as well as over speakers in the Student Union building.</p>

<p>Flyers, posters, 45rpm records, and other ephemera from the old station space (which was just down the hall and was WPIR&#8217;s home circa 2006-2023) adorn the walls of the two-room studio and a basket is filled with Polaroid photos of station members from the past. Formerly home to an interfaith lounge, the new WPIR space is divided in half by a window. The furthest room functions as a radio booth, where show hosts sit to do their programs. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WPIR&#8217;s Whimsical Communication System During Live Shows</h2>



<p>The front room is where a &#8220;runner&#8221; sits, transmitting each live show to the internet stream. Initially station board members played that role, but now every show host is required to also &#8220;run&#8221; another program. A large collection of colorful, hand-drawn, whimsical signs featuring tips and inspirational messages sits on the counter. These signs are used as props by the show runner, as a way to communicate words of encouragement to the DJ or host. Messages include suggestions like, &#8220;The mic isn&#8217;t picking up your voice. Speak closer,&#8221; as well as praise, such as &#8220;This song slaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the time of my visit, DJs at WPIR only played digital music. However, inside a metal cabinet is a small collection of CDs, cassettes, LPs and 7&#8243; inch records, along with cables and miscellaneous audio equipment. A stack of cover-less vintage records also sits in the studio. While these items hint at a longer station history, it&#8217;s difficult to discern the station&#8217;s precise trajectory over the past few decades. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WPIR Pratt&#8217;s Early College Radio Days over AM Carrier Current</h2>



<p>Originally an AM carrier current station dating back to 1966, WPIR broadcast nightly at 600kc on AM from the first floor of the Willoughby dorm at Pratt, according to a 1971 residence hall handbook. These transmissions could eventually be heard across multiple dorms on campus. Although it was unlicensed carrier current, WPIR was seen as an important communications tool. A letter in student newspaper <em>The Prattler</em>, following student activism efforts and turmoil in 1969, states, &#8220;The utilization of radio, WPIR, posters and flyers through quantity and quality, can also aid in securing an informal, involved student body.&#8221; </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1970s Scene at WPIR Pratt Radio</h2>



<p>By the 1970s, WPIR DJs were spinning records on a variety of music shows. One such show was a late night rhythm and blues program hosted by future music industry professional Karen L. Glover, who post-graduation was editor of <em>Black Beat</em> magazine and a music supervisor for films. Other examples of music genres being played in this era can be found in a list of stolen WPIR records during the 1974-1975 academic year. A 1975 article in <em>Drum</em>, a publication by the Black Students Union of Pratt, digs into &#8220;PIR Piracy: The Missing Black Records at WPIR,&#8221; and mentions that 37 records (mostly featuring Black artists) went missing between September and April. On the list were albums from jazz musician Ramsey Lewis, soul singer Minnie Riperton, funk rock band Labelle, comedian Franklin Ajaye, and artist Carl Douglas (specifically, his disco release &#8220;Kung Fu Fighting&#8221;).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1980s Equipment Theft and Revival</h2>



<p>WPIR continued as a campus-only broadcaster into the 1980s. According to a 1991 article in <em>The Prattler</em>, &#8220;in the early 80&#8217;s WPIR was a &#8216;pirate&#8217; station, broadcasting without the schools [sic] or the FCC&#8217;s permission. Then all the equipment was stolen.&#8221; The article states that in 1984 a freshman, Janell Genovese, &#8220;started it back up from scratch,&#8221; overseeing WPIR until 1989, when she passed the job on to Daniel Fries.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WPIR&#8217;s Foray into Unlicensed FM Broadcasts</h2>



<p>Fries was very interested in taking WPIR to the FM airwaves over very low power. After finding a frequency, he began broadcasts on the far left side of the dial (he thinks 87.9 FM) in November, 1990. Several months later, on April 1, 1991, the FCC sent a letter to higher ups at Pratt, asking that WPIR cease their FM transmissions or risk a $100,000 fine. </p>

<p>At the time, Fries told <em>The Prattler</em> that he was surprised because he had &#8220;counseled&#8221; with &#8220;representatives&#8221; who had &#8220;deemed the broadcast of WPIR, if low power, unlicensable.&#8221; I reached out to Fries and he made some clarifications, explaining that he&#8217;d spoken with a consultant as well as with engineers on campus. &#8220;We determined that at a very low power we could limit the range pretty easily&#8230;I was counseled that under a certain power output it was considered legal without a license,&#8221; he said, adding that the plan was to operate legal low power unlicensed broadcasts, complying with FCC&#8217;s Part 15 rules. These same regulations under Part 15 are what allow for legal, unlicensed campus-only AM carrier current broadcasts.</p>

<p>A former WPIR staffer wrote a more colorful account some years later on the station&#8217;s website, saying that, &#8220;&#8230;the short-lived glory days were perhaps 3-4 months, where we were heard all over the 5 boroughs. We had a great time anyhow, promoting shows &#8211; including bands like Fishbone, They Might Be Giants (Pratt alumni themselves), Swirlies, 24-7 Spies, and so on.&#8221; However, Fries maintains that those FM broadcasts were much more limited, with &#8220;maybe a mile radius&#8221; from Pratt&#8217;s Brooklyn campus.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WPIR&#8217;s Return to AM</h2>



<p>After shutting down its low power FM broadcasts, WPIR planned to go back to AM carrier current and increase awareness of the station on campus. <em>The Prattler</em> noted, &#8220;Not many people at Pratt know that this institute has a radio station. Even less know its recent history.&#8221;  </p>

<p>A former staffer spoke of efforts to continue broadcasting after this setback, writing about this history on the WPIR website (circa 2007), &#8220;My wife (the then GM) and I tried to resurrect the station as a campus-only &#8216;leaky cable&#8217; system, which uses a low-power signal that radiates perhaps 100 feet max from the cable &#8211; so it&#8217;d be run around campus, down hallways, up elevator shafts, and so on. Never worked out too well, as I couldn&#8217;t get the damned cable across Willoughby Avenue! Some sort of hoo-ha permitting that sort of thing, so we gave up.&#8221; A 1994 yearbook mentions a return to AM following the whole FCC debacle.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WPIR Transitions Online in the 2000s</h2>



<p>The station&#8217;s pirate radio past is immortalized in some of the station&#8217;s branding, as evidenced by a pirate flag with WPIR call letters hanging in the current studio. With its forays into AM and FM broadcasting behind them, Pratt Radio shifted to internet streaming somewhere between 2001 and 2004 and even introduced podcasts as early as 2006. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WPIR Pratt Radio&#8217;s Post-COVID Revival</h2>



<p>To current students (as was the case decades ago!), the history of Pratt Radio is very murky. And in the shadow of COVID, just getting WPIR up and running again has been the main focus of their attention. When I met up with four WPIR board members in late March, 2023 they spoke of their work to bring the station back to life. All sophomores at the time (a fifth board member was a senior), they had not experienced Pratt Radio pre-COVID, so much of what they knew about the station came from conversations with upperclassmen and their advisor as well as from digging into past postings on Instagram. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2020 WPIR Frozen in Time</h2>



<p>Since WPIR was inactive for a bit, current station participants also had to do some sleuthing in order to get back on social media. However, the station&#8217;s wonderfully designed <a href="https://prattradio.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tumblr site</a> remains inaccessible and is frozen in time. One page shows the Spring 2020 schedule, packed with 53 shows, hosted by students, faculty/staff, and alumni. It&#8217;s easy to imagine the enthusiasm that everyone had when that schedule was posted at the start of 2020, but of course everything changed that March of 2020. By fall, 2020 shows were being done remotely, with some hosts recording programs using the voice memo app on their phones. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bringing WPIR Pratt Radio Back in 2022-2023 School Year</h2>



<p>As we chatted in the quiet studio (except for a constant hum of construction and periodic banging noises from a sculpture class upstairs) in March, 2023 during a mid-day break in programming, I learned more about what brought this group of people together to help bring back college radio on campus. Lili Leoung Tat described the situation at WPIR in the 2021-2022 school year, telling me that &#8220;it was kind of dead&#8221; and that &#8220;there wasn&#8217;t really anyone running it.&#8221; In fall 2022, she was part of the group that brought the station back from the &#8220;ground up.&#8221; Around 45 people signed up to be part of WPIR that semester, with 21 shows making it to &#8220;air.&#8221; By the spring, the number of shows had increased to 28. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Allure of College Radio for WPIR&#8217;s Student Leaders</h2>



<p>Amazingly, this small group of students, new to radio, quickly revived the dormant WPIR. Interestingly, several had relatives, including cousins and parents who had worked in college radio or radio in general. WPIR board member Arzu Oran reflected back on an older cousin who had done college radio, saying &#8220;he always seemed so cool,&#8221; adding that this was part of her desire to join a college radio station, &#8220;especially at an art school&#8221; like Pratt. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Coincidentally, fellow board member Eve Mikkelson also had an older cousin who did college radio. She was partially drawn to Pratt Radio because she thought it would be the &#8220;perfect way to meet a bunch of people.&#8221; The newest board member (she was a week into her term when we all meet in March), Mikkelson talked about how much she enjoys doing her show, &#8220;Brooklyn Buzz,&#8221; which highlights Brooklyn artists. &#8220;Getting to curate what you play and what you say, it&#8217;s just a really nice form of expression,&#8221; she explained, adding, &#8220;You&#8217;re picking all your favorite things and you&#8217;re getting to share it with as many people as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Similarly, Oran, who hosts &#8220;Kraving Kibbeh,&#8221; spoke philosophically about the experience of listening to music &#8220;actively,&#8221; without distractions. She finds herself doing that much more while participating in college radio at WPIR, where she is more likely to listen to music &#8220;fully.&#8221; She said, &#8220;It feels so nice to actively listen&#8221; to both her own program as well as other shows on WPIR.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Building Community at Pratt Institute</h2>



<p>In addition to the joy of &#8220;doing&#8221; radio, the participants at WPIR talked about the satisfaction that they felt in contributing to campus life. &#8220;I really like that we&#8217;re leaving a mark on the campus, because we&#8217;re helping to relaunch the Pratt radio station,&#8221; said board member Colin Coffey. He continued, &#8220;Hopefully we&#8217;ll keep thriving after we graduate&#8230;it&#8217;s just a nice community that we&#8217;ve built.&#8221; Leoung Tat agreed, adding that the station community is also building connections with other groups. She mentioned that several clubs have reached out to collaborate with WPIR. One organization, Queer Pratt, inquired about having DJs spin at an event and the student book club asked WPIR to curate playlists for their meetings.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fall 2023 Shows at WPIR Pratt Radio</h2>



<p>WPIR is up and running again this semester, with all four of the board members who I met in the spring still active on the Pratt Radio Board. When I tuned in to the stream in mid-October, 2023, there were 25 shows on the <a href="https://wpirprattradio.cargo.site/Schedule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fall schedule</a> running from about noon to 10pm. The broad range of programs include &#8220;Eli&#8217;s Experimental Hour,&#8221; &#8220;Jesus Wept,&#8221; &#8220;Evil Hour,&#8221; &#8220;Show Tunes Swag,&#8221; &#8220;Tuning into the 2000s,&#8221; &#8220;Clowns, Cowboys &amp; Punks,&#8221; and more. An edition of &#8220;Nocturnal Emissions&#8221; that I caught featured bands with under 20,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, which I thought was an interesting way to feature more underground artists.</p>

<p>Thanks to WPIR Pratt Radio for the wonderful visit. Also many thanks to WPIR advisor and Associate Director for the Student Union Alexander Ullman for taking time to speak with me. Additional appreciation goes to Brendan Enright, Project Archivist at the Pratt Institute for research assistance and for digging up some vital materials in the archives. And, finally, thanks to WPIR alum Daniel Fries for sharing his memories with me, helping to shed light on the station&#8217;s pirate radio rumors.</p>



<p>This is my 173rd radio station tour report and my 115th college radio station recap.

<p>With killer views from the 7th floor of a building in the heart of New York City, it&#8217;s no surprise that DJs at The School of Visual Arts&#8217; (SVA) college radio station <a href="https://wsvaradio.sva.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WSVA</a> joke about wanting to live at the station. &#8220;I would love to have this as my apartment,&#8221; said Michelle Mullin, WSVA&#8217;s Manager of Operations. Similarly, alumnus Jacob Gardner, who uses they/he pronouns, admitted to napping at the station, especially since their apartment was in another borough. Beyond WSVA being a lovely space physically, the station also feels welcoming to its participants. &#8220;There&#8217;s actual life in this place,&#8221; explained Alice Katok, the station&#8217;s Manager of Production, contrasting it with the closet-like conditions of her apartment. Especially after a few isolating years of COVID, it&#8217;s clear that students are gravitating to college radio station WSVA in order to be part of a community of like-minded music enthusiasts.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WSVA Punk Show and Community Connections</h2>



<p>And that community is growing beyond the walls of WSVA. The station hosted a sold-out punk show in February, 2023 (its first in recent memory) and 70 people showed up. Mullin was impressed by the turn out, saying that she&#8217;d never seen more than 30 people at a school event in her time at SVA. Although it was restricted to SVA-affiliated people, they even got some RSVPs from people who aren&#8217;t connected with the school. This outside interest was gratifying to WSVA and a sign to them that they are on an upswing.</p>

<p>Katok mentioned that they&#8217;ve also been getting communication from more artists and have had to turn down requests from bands to play. Additionally, WSVA has heard from folks at nearby colleges and college radio stations at FIT, Hunter College, NYU, and the New School about possibly collaborating on events. Mullin said that she feels &#8220;lucky&#8221; that WSVA has so much creative freedom; in part because the station is internet-only. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">College Radio Station WSVA Feels Like an Art School</h2>



<p>These days, WSVA is buzzing with activity. Gardner said that there were 40 shows in spring 2023 as well as a record number of listeners on the online station&#8217;s stream. And, specific attempts to make the station &#8220;more accessible&#8221; and &#8220;less cliquey&#8221; are paying off. &#8220;I tell everyone I know, you can come here, you don&#8217;t have to have a show,&#8221; Mullin remarked, adding, &#8220;I love coming in&#8230;and seeing 10 people in here.&#8221; Gardner explained that WSVA is &#8220;supposed to be a space that everybody can enjoy,&#8221; and pointed out that the station really &#8220;feels like an art school.&#8221; And it&#8217;s true. There&#8217;s art everywhere, including random paintings, sculpture projects, drawings on the walls, and a shared notebook packed with sketches. The WSVA Sketchbook was a new addition in February, 2023. Additionally, a &#8220;doodle challenge&#8221; on the wall of WSVA encourages DJs to &#8220;draw your favorite album from memory.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Looking Back at WSVA During COVID</h2>



<p>This creative, in-person energy is quite the contrast to the past few years during COVID. WSVA was completely shut down in spring 2020. By the summer, they had created a virtual studio over Discord and test ran a station on Twitch, where they even held a dance party. By fall, 2020 WSVA was running shows over Twitch. For Gardner, it served as their only social interaction, which they characterized as &#8220;commiseration&#8221; during an especially challenging time for students. </p>



<p>By fall, 2021, WSVA was back in its 7th floor studio, although work had to be done to spruce it up after it had been sitting idle for over a year. In-person shows resumed in October, 2021, with around 36 programs on the schedule. &#8220;I think people were just excited to do anything,&#8221; recalled Katok about this reawakening on campus. There were still restrictions in place, with only 3 people allowed in WSVA at a time in fall, 2021. &#8220;I was here typically alone,&#8221; Katok said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WSVA Re-Energized in 2022-2023 School Year</h2>



<p>However, by the 2022-2023 academic year. WSVA was even more energized, which was quite palpable when I visited in late March, 2023. &#8220;I&#8217;ve definitely noticed a shift this year,&#8221; remarked Katok, adding, &#8220;more people are curious&#8221; about the radio station. Along with that, WSVA is attracting more attention. Gardner joked that when they started at the school, the radio station was like the &#8220;Bigfoot of SVA,&#8221; with students not realizing that WSVA even existed. Another positive shift was that some younger staff members were in place this spring, with many of them still in leadership positions in fall, 2023. Having continuity is helpful, especially with the disruption during COVID.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">College Radio Station WSVA&#8217;s Lively Space</h2>



<p>The lively WSVA space is covered with flyers from past events, as well as promotional posters and stickers from prior eras of the station. The on-air studio is sweetly outfitted with a nice leather couch and matching chair, a cute floral armchair, and multi-colored plastic crates full of vinyl records. A red pitchfork is propped in one corner and posters and flyers cover the walls. A handful of CDs sit in the station window, which faces the entryway to the station. Another studio currently serves more like a storage area, but seems like it may have functioned as a production studio or news studio in the past. </p>

<p>These days, WSVA DJs are playing a wide range of genres. The folks who I met up with mentioned playing folk, mid-western emo, 1950s doo-wop, and hardcore. And by this fall, the 37 shows on the schedule included &#8220;Love Letter to an LP,&#8221; &#8220;Emo to the Extremo,&#8221; &#8220;Fiona&#8217;s iPod Shuffle,&#8221; &#8220;Into the Pit,&#8221; &#8220;Anti Wave,&#8221; &#8220;Girlie &amp; Pop,&#8221; and more.</p>

<p>Although the WSVA crew recognizes the freedom that affords them as an internet-only college radio station; they also expressed some wistfulness about not having a spot on the terrestrial dial. We chatted about the station formerly being on AM, but not much was known about that time. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Mysterious History of College Radio Station WSVA</h2>



<p>Part of the challenge is that there is no written WSVA history. And the &#8220;about us&#8221; section of WSVA&#8217;s website circa January 2008 is comically spot-on when articulating this lack of a detailed station history. According to the post, &#8220;WSVA was founded&#8230;well, we actually don&#8217;t know when. I&#8217;m assuming it was some time in the late 80s or early 90s. Then it was shut down for a while and opened up again sometime in the late 90s. Again, we don&#8217;t know exactly when this was.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Early Days of WSVA: 1980s</h2>



<p>While WSVA&#8217;s &#8220;history is shrouded in mystery,&#8221; according to Gardner, there are little kernels of details around the station. Formerly a carrier current radio station at 590 AM, WSVA is rumored to have started in 1970. Throughout the 1980s, the college radio station broadcast over carrier current and into various spaces on campus. Events included a &#8220;Battle of the Bands&#8221; in spring 1986, with participants selected based on demo tapes. At the time, the station used the branding &#8220;WSVA 590 Rock 59.&#8221; </p>



<p>One featured program was &#8220;Overtones,&#8221; which played progressive jazz fusion and new age music. Other shows included the &#8220;heavy music&#8221; oriented &#8220;16 Tons&#8221; as well the &#8220;Rockin&#8217; Rob Show,&#8221; which played new wave music, rock, rap, comedy and interviews. By spring, 1987, it seemed that WSVA&#8217;s space had been reduced, with it now occupying only a portion of the 7th floor lounge that was its home. An article SVA&#8217;s student newspaper <em>Canvas</em> states, &#8220;Our sound can be heard in the incredible shrinking seventh floor lounge Monday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Fridays 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. We can also be heard in the cafeteria every day from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., and soon-to-be in the afternoons as well.&#8221; </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1980s Programming </h2>



<p>Additionally, a new show in spring 1987 was an on-air classifieds-type program, &#8220;The Bulletin Board,&#8221; which aired at 3:30pm every day. WSVA also offered to buy records from anyone on campus that spring. A local music show, &#8220;Homegrown,&#8221; began in fall 1986 and by spring, 1987 it had received material from a variety of bands, including The Crunge, Me and My Bro, Norman Bates and the Showerheads, Sidney and the Homewreckers, and the Rescue. In fall, 1987, the station was airing music (including a classical show), hourly newscasts, talk shows, and a comedy show within its mix of programming. </p>

<p>An October, 1989 account in <em>Canvas</em> reported on delays in broadcasting that fall due to an explosion in Gramercy Park and a New York Telephone strike. With new equipment, the station was gearing up to broadcast from 7am to 5pm on weekdays into four SVA buildings: Sloane House and lounges at East 21st Street, East 23rd Street, and West 21st Street. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Early 2000s at College Radio Station WSVA</h2>



<p>Posters and stickers at WSVA from the internet era include the spot on the AM dial, suggesting that carrier current persisted into at least the early 2000s. Photographer Noah Kalina was Music Director at WSVA in the early 2000s and posted an anecdote about what the station was like during that time. While at the station he compiled charts to send to the industry publication, <em>CMJ</em>. Coincidentally, years later, he shot a <em>CMJ</em> cover featuring the musician Sia. </p>

<p>On his <a href="https://blog.noahkalina.com/post/22267272/noah-kalina-photo-of-sia-on-the-cover-of-cmj-new/amp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>, Kalina reflects back on his time at WSVA:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>WSVA is a radio station nobody at the school even knew existed. It only broadcast in the school cafeteria which was 3 blocks away and they never had the volume up loud enough to hear it. We basically sat around the station all day making up the music charts we had to send in to CMJ. We would also field calls from all of the music publicists further perpetuating the myth that we were a legitimate radio station. This insured that the station could continue to receive tons and tons of promo CD’s and we could keep our jobs.</p>



<p>There was absolutely no authority so we basically made it up as we went along. It was the best job anybody in college could ever ask for, not to mention it was two flights above the darkrooms. How or why we ever got paid will always remain a mystery. </p>



<p>Judging by the look of the current website (we never had a website) not much has changed. It does however seem like they are doing a really fancy itunes stream. I am so proud of them.</p>

<p>Over email, Kalina shared more reminiscences with me, as well as some photos that he took of the station during his time there from 2000 to 2001. He explained that even though WSVA was piped into the cafeteria, it was an underused space, limiting their audience even further. He added, &#8220;They said it was in the dorms too, but it wasn&#8217;t.&#8221; As far as the music of the era, he mentioned, &#8220;&#8230;we basically had Radiohead KID A on repeat non-stop so that album marks that time for me. Fall/Winter 2000. Unforgettable.&#8221;&nbsp;He also recalled that a major renovation took place at WSVA in late April, 2001; which he captured in photos before the work has been completed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Early Streaming at WSVA Limited to the Campus</h2>



<p>While its unclear when internet broadcasting started for WSVA, it does seem that it was initially limited to campus networks. Vintage stickers posted at the radio station include a URL for Pipeline, which likely provided an intranet for the campus, seemingly between 2001 and 2008ish. In 2005, a comment on WSVA&#8217;s LiveJournal site said, &#8220;SVA should invest in a WSVA server for some sort of podcasting system, allowing for listeners outside of the campus! That&#8217;s what I think. Any ideas on implementing such a system?&#8221; A post on the station&#8217;s website four years later, in fall 2009, indicated that these broadcasts were still &#8220;limited to our school&#8217;s network.&#8221; </p>

<p>By spring 2011, WSVA could be heard streaming &#8220;via the magical internet, so listeners are able to tune in all across the world.&#8221; Some of these shows from this era were also posted as podcasts as well. Although I&#8217;m unsure about when carrier current broadcasting ended for WSVA, it appears that by 2013, the station was only streaming online. They also installed a webcam in 2013 and a few videos can be found on YouTube circa 2017. Also in the early 2000s, there were at least two different &#8216;zines produced by WSVA, including one called STATIC, and later a webzine called Xzyqunity.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Lore from WSVA&#8217;s Past</h2>



<p>Mullin, Katok and Gardner were interested to learn more about WSVA&#8217;s past and have made attempts at research. Gardner found some recordings of shows circa 2017 and they have had requests from station alumni looking for even earlier archives. Gardner said that they are proud of WSVA alumni like musician Mike Krol. <a href="https://wsvaradio.sva.edu/media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An interview</a> with him is on the current WSVA website and Krol shares some memories of his time at the radio station in the early 2000s. </p>



<p>Rumors of a 1990 Kurt Cobain visit to the station are unverified, but there&#8217;s also SVA chatter about artists Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring (who attended SVA) hanging out in the school cafeteria. A friend of mine, John Devecka, who worked for carrier current equipment manufacturer LPB, recalled visiting WSVA circa 1995-1996 and seeing Keith Haring graffiti in the building&#8217;s stairwell. Devecka was there to test the carrier current system as well as to explore the possibility of installing radiating cable FM. Unfortunately with the layout of the building, it was found to be too expensive to shift to FM at that time.</p>

<p>While this mysterious history is alluring, today&#8217;s WSVA participants also worry about this lack of awareness of the station&#8217;s past. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want this place to be lost in history,&#8221; Katok explained. Mullin added that some of her professors seemed completely unaware of WSVA&#8217;s existence; although she noted, &#8220;We&#8217;ve been alive this whole time.&#8221;</p>

<p>During our chat in the spring, Gardner mentioned that WSVA had hoped to do a &#8216;zine again; so I was excited to see a post calling for writers and &#8216;zine contributors on the WSVA Instagram in October, 2023. Especially thrilling for me is that history will be part of that &#8216;zine. The post says, &#8220;We want to document the history of the radio station, as well as feature the works of our DJs who make WSVA possible.&#8221; I can&#8217;t wait to see the finished &#8216;zine and wish WSVA luck in sleuthing out more stories from its 50+ year history.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone at WSVA for the warm welcome and fun visit in March, 2023. I&#8217;m also very grateful to Beth Kleber, Head of Archives for the School of Visual Arts Archives for help in locating WSVA material from the 1980s.

<p>Happy <a href="https://www.collegeradio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World College Radio Day</a>! October 6, 2023 marks the 13th annual College Radio Day. As part of the festivities at Radio Survivor, we did a special episode of the podcast/radio show: <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2023/10/podcast-334-college-radios-hidden-early-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">College Radio&#8217;s Hidden Early History</a>. On the show, I talk about the role that radio clubs played in germinating some of the first student-run college radio stations. One such club, at my alma mater Haverford College, launched broadcast AM radio station WABQ in 1923. On October 9, 1923, a couple of months before WABQ hit the airwaves, a headline in Haverford&#8217;s student newspaper announced, &#8220;Broadcasting Station Nears Completion.&#8221; Clearly the radio club had high aspirations, with the article pointing out that, &#8220;Members of the club feel confident that Haverford will be very definitely on the Radio Map when the station opens up.&#8221; As one of the first student-led radio stations, WABQ deserves a place in radio history, even though <a href="http://spinningindie.blogspot.com/2009/08/haverford-college-radios-heyday-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its time on the radio dial was brief</a>. </p>



<p>After a few years, Haverford College&#8217;s WABQ license was sold (by the students in the club), and broadcasting did not return to campus until carrier current stations (WHAV, later renamed WHRC) were built in the early 1940s. These limited broadcasts could only be heard in the dorms on AM radios or over speakers in the dining center at Haverford College (and later Bryn Mawr College too). As a carrier current station, WHRC persisted for around 50 years, until various technological issues caused it to morph into an internet radio station. WHRC died and was reborn several times; most recently returning in fall, 2022. This week, I posted an article about the folks who <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2023/10/college-radio-revival-at-haverford-colleges-whrc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought radio back to Haverford College</a>, amid the myriad challenges of the pandemic. As with student leaders of the past, the current managers of <a href="https://whrc-radio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WHRC</a> are a huge source of inspiration to me. College radio is such a special place and it warms my heart that new generations of students continue to build radio stations and form new radio communities.</p>

<p>A casual comment during a college orientation session in 2020 was the spark that led to the revival of college radio station <a href="https://whrc-radio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WHRC</a> at Haverford College. Although Haverford had <a href="http://spinningindie.blogspot.com/2009/08/haverford-college-radios-heyday-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the earliest student-led radio stations in the 1920s</a> (WABQ, whose first broadcast was 100 years ago in 1923!) and a <a href="http://spinningindie.blogspot.com/2009/04/ups-and-downs-of-haverford-college.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very active AM carrier current station starting in the early 1940s</a> (WHAV and then WHRC); the 2000s have seen the <a href="http://spinningindie.blogspot.com/2009/06/radio-station-field-trip-16-haverford.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">death</a> and <a href="http://spinningindie.blogspot.com/2014/10/radio-station-field-trip-165-whrc-at.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rebirth</a> of many different iterations of radio on the small liberal arts school campus just outside of Philadelphia. It seemed that WHRC had disappeared for good circa 2017, but I continued to hear rumblings every so often about renewed interest in bringing the station back. By fall, 2022, <a href="https://haver.blog/2022/10/06/club-life-college-radio-lives-again-in-whrc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WHRC was alive and active again</a>. Against all odds, students were able to reclaim a portion of WHRC&#8217;s long-time dining center basement home and build a new radio station. The latest version of WHRC began streaming live in September, 2022 and launched its website in February, 2023. In spring semester 2023, the station had around 80 participants and more than 50 radio shows.</p>

<p>Astonishingly, the new WHRC came together pretty quickly, especially during a pandemic. WHRC&#8217;s original co-heads Sarah Mastrocola and Natalie White arrived on campus as sophomore transfer students in the fall of 2020. Both had come from schools with radio stations and Mastrocola had even done college radio at her previous school. During Haverford&#8217;s orientation week (over Zoom) someone asked if the college had a radio station and Sarah and Natalie immediately said to each other &#8220;maybe we can start it.&#8221; Although there was this initial kernel of an idea in 2020, it was another year until the two began the work to create a new radio station.</p>



<p>A strange coincidence happened in spring 2021, when the HBO series <em>Mare of Easttown</em> debuted. Taking place in the Philadelphia area, <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2021/07/creating-haverford-college-radio-on-mare-of-easttown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a few episodes featured a fictionalized student radio station at Haverford College</a>. Mastrocola said, &#8220;The timing was pretty comical&#8230;it definitely inspired us to sort of live up to that standard of, well, on television it says we have a radio station.&#8221; She joked about her reaction at the time, recalling her thought that, &#8220;I guess the universe is telling us, it&#8217;s time to bring this radio station back.&#8221; Although the remarks about the fake radio station on the show were more of a &#8220;funny thing that people would say,&#8221; those comments &#8220;sparked conversation.&#8221; White added that even though the show wasn&#8217;t the reason that they relaunched WHRC, it did still generate interest in radio amongst Haverford and Bryn Mawr students. </p>



<p>By Fall of 2021, Natalie approached Sarah about realizing their collective radio dream. They went into full research mode, talking to students, faculty, and administrators. They secured funding to start the radio station and obtained approval to form a student club. Additionally, they reached out to nearby college radio station <a href="https://wxvu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WXVU at Villanova</a> to get advice about radio station operations. Mastrocola and White then held an preliminary interest meeting in spring semester of 2022 to let students know about their plans and get others involved. A huge accomplishment that spring was WHRC being granted access to a space in the dining center basement that had most recently been used as a recording studio by students. </p>

<p>WHRC activities ramped up in fall 2022. The club started an Instagram account and began promoting the idea of the station. More than 120 students signed up to join during Haverford&#8217;s Club Fair. The station officially launched and starting streaming in September, 2022 and had around 30 shows that semester. The first program on the air was a mid-day show devoted to music from the television show <em>Glee</em>. </p>



<p>When I spoke to Mastrocola and White in spring 2023, they reported that the schedule had expanded to 53 shows, with around 80 members of the radio club. Students from Haverford College and Bryn Mawr College (and some faculty) did shows live from the studio, streaming to listeners on campus and all over the world. At the time, the schedule was a mix of talk (including a sports show and three shows about relationships) and music shows (heavy metal, indie, and more), with participants playing music from digital sources. One show was done entirely in Spanish too. Shows were 30 or 60 minutes long and were scheduled from around noon to 10pm, depending on the day.</p>



<p>Last semester was especially active at WHRC. In addition to the debut of the website, WHRC presented a live music session, broadcasting a modular synthesizer performance by visiting professor <a href="http://mattohare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt O&#8217;Hare</a>. And, Mastrocola and White taught a P.E. class focused on radio! Mastrocola explained that they helped students become radio journalists and create podcasts for P.E. credit. Students wrote scripts, compiled audio, and conducted interviews, with the resulting audio airing over WHRC. One cohort covered the <a href="https://www.haverford.edu/haverfarm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HaverFarm</a> and ecological topics on the Haverford campus.</p>

<p>Although the WHRC of the past was outfitted with equipment to play vinyl records and CDs, the current station does not have a physical music library (or turntables, CD players, or tape decks). The collection of LPs and CDs from WHRC&#8217;s earlier incarnations has dwindled away. While the 2023 studio occupies a portion of the old WHRC space (originally built in the early 1970s) in the dining center basement, the rooms have been reconfigured. The studio now borders a band practice room. That can be tricky when the station is on the air and I was told that WHRC is hoping to get a soundproof door to help dampen outside noises. This challenge came into focus from me while tuning in to a recent show, as music could be heard drifting in from a Jazz Club gathering.</p>

<p>A big goal of the new radio club and revamped WHRC space at Haverford is for it to be &#8220;chill&#8221; and &#8220;accessible,&#8221; as well as a &#8220;fun communal space to hang out,&#8221; according to Mastrocola. With such a huge number of participants joining the station this past spring, it&#8217;s clear that radio is alluring to students. She cited a number of reasons, including, on the surface, radio&#8217;s &#8220;retro aesthetic.&#8221; But perhaps more importantly, she talked about the power of sharing ideas and sounds with one&#8217;s community. Mastrocola explained that radio is a &#8220;medium of performance that excludes all of the nerve-wracking elements of performance,&#8221; adding that, &#8220;You can share your music with the community. And yet you&#8217;re kind of the star of your own show, but there&#8217;s no stakes to it&#8230;It&#8217;s all for fun.&#8221; </p>

</div>


<p>Along with that, White noted that the station&#8217;s revival coincided with the increasing popularity of podcasts and audio-based content. She was working on her senior thesis on podcasting when we spoke in the spring and remarked that the surge of podcast listening in the pandemic likely led  students to radio at Haverford, pointing out that some of WHRC&#8217;s shows are very podcast-like. </p>



<p>Although co-heads Mastrocola and White graduated in the spring, they passed the leadership of WHRC to other enthusiastic participants who just finalized the fall schedule. Filled with nearly 50 shows, some highlights include &#8220;Locals Only,&#8221; &#8220;Loud Music,&#8221; &#8220;Anatolian Hour,&#8221; &#8220;Anna&#8217;s Book Nook,&#8221; &#8220;Adolescent Phases,&#8221; and &#8220;Politics and Policy.&#8221; </p>



<p>While launching a station is no small task, I&#8217;m very pleased that Mastrocola and White were also very keyed in to the history of radio at Haverford. The website is full of vintage photos of their predecessors at WHRC, WHAV and WABQ; and they&#8217;ve re-adopted a WHRC dinosaur logo created by Diane Davison, WHRC&#8217;s general manager in the late 1980s. White was excited to find the old logo, saying, &#8220;it was so cool getting the back story.&#8221; She spent a lot of time digging into the college&#8217;s WHRC/WHAV/WABQ archives and posted many history tidbits on the station&#8217;s Instagram in appreciation of Haverford&#8217;s long radio story. </p>

</div>


<p>Another dream of White&#8217;s was to develop a WHRC alumni directory for the website, to further connect WHRC participants, past and present. Similarly amazed by the station&#8217;s history and archives, Mastrocola told me that she was encouraged after &#8220;seeing this history of student leadership inspired by passion for radio.&#8221; She added, &#8220;It&#8217;s really cool to continue that legacy&#8221; of radio at Haverford and &#8220;having it be&#8230;one more bookmark in the WHRC history book is pretty wild.&#8221; When I asked if it was bittersweet to be graduating so soon after re-launching the station, both were philosophical, with Natalie pointing out, &#8220;you can always tune in to radio&#8230;there&#8217;s always that trace there.&#8221; Sarah struck an optimistic tone, especially since the &#8220;archives have survived,&#8221; and then surmised, &#8220;&#8221;even if the radio does die out again after 10 years or so, it will probably get resurrected by someone else and the history will always be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>World College Radio Day takes place on October 6, 2023 and in honor of that, we dig into the early history of college radio on our latest episode of the show. Jennifer Waits walks us through her research about college radio in the 1920s and earlier, sharing details from a paper that she presented this past spring at the Radio Preservation Task Force Conference at the Library of Congress. In that paper, she argues that we should be broadening our definitions of what college radio is, pointing out examples of radio clubs, radio experiments, and amateur radio activities that mirror the activities of future &#8220;broadcast&#8221; stations. </p>



<p>Jennifer recounts stories from more than 100 years ago, pointing out the incredible contributions that students have made to radio history. Along the way, we hear tales about early student radio practitioners at places like Haverford College, Union College, Harvard University, and Columbia University. Jennifer also asks for listeners to share details that they may have about very early college radio (1920s and earlier) at other schools.</p>

<p>The 13th annual <a href="https://www.collegeradio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World College Radio Day</a> takes place on Friday, October 6, 2023. <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2011/06/college-radio-day-hits-the-airwaves-on-october-11-2011/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Conceived of by Rob Quicke as a celebration of student radio</a>, College Radio Day has grown over the years to include an international mix of stations, all honoring the day in their own unique ways. The event also includes a <a href="https://www.collegeradio.org/24-hour-global-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global marathon</a>, featuring a variety of college radio stations. This year, the marathon begins on Friday, October 6 at midnight Eastern time with the Vox Populi out of Fiji. Every 30 to 60 minutes, a different station will pass the baton. Participants will be far flung, including stations from Argentina, Greece, Mexico, Malaysia, China, Ireland, Spain, the United States, and more.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Special World College Radio Day Episode of the Radio Survivor Show</h2>



<p>We are also celebrating World College Radio Day on Radio Survivor. Stay tuned for a special <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/category/podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radio show/podcast</a> episode (<a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2023/10/podcast-334-college-radios-hidden-early-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#334</a>) launching this week, focusing on the early days of college radio. On the show, I share stories and tidbits from my research about student radio activities on campuses in the first few decades of the 20th century (mainly focusing on the 1920s). I presented on this topic at the <a href="https://radiopreservation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radio Preservation Task Force</a> <a href="https://radiopreservation.org/2023-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Conference</a> at the Library of Congress last spring, so am happy to bring this work to a broader audience of Radio Survivor listeners. The history of college radio is full of incredible stories about passionate, creative, and innovative young leaders, artists, and technologists and I love digging into the archives to highlight students&#8217; inspiring work.</p>

<p><br>The first in-person&nbsp;<a href="https://www.2023grassrootsradioconference.com/">Grassroots Radio Conference</a>&nbsp;since 2019 is happening in Charleston, West Virginia October 19 &#8211; 22, 2023. Hosted by community radio station&nbsp;<a href="https://wtsq.org/">WTSQ</a>, the conference is an opportunity for staff, volunteers and supporters from community, college and LPFM stations to come together to learn, exchange ideas and inspiration to keep grassroots radio thriving in North America and beyond.</p>



<p>Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman is a featured keynote speaker, along with Alex Sanjenis, an Assistant Chief in the Audio Division of the FCC Media Bureau. Having a representative of the FCC is a real boon to groups planning to apply for a new low-power FM license in the upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2023/06/new-opportunity-for-low-power-fm-community-radio-stations-opens-november-1-2023/">November application window</a>. However, in general, potential applicants can expect to find plenty of advice among the conference attendees, who collectively have decades of experience building and running community and college radio stations.</p>



<p>Other featured speakers include: Dr. Rob Quicke, founder of the annual Vinylthon event, College Radio Day, and co-founder of World College Radio Day; Dr. MarkAlain Dery, an infectious disease physician and public health practitioner in New Orleans, who with his wife, co-founded 102.3FM WHIV-LP; Joseph Orozco, Board member to the Pacifica Association of Affiliates; Maria Martin, an award-winning multi-media journalist who currently directs the GraciasVida Center for Media, a nonprofit organization based in Texas and La Antigua, Guatemala devoted to the practice of independent journalism in the public interest; and LaGanzie Kale, the founder and General Manager of KLEK 102.5 F.M., the first and only minority operated radio station in Jonesboro, Arkansas.</p>



<p>If you need financial assistance to attend, Amy Goodman has donated her speaking fee to fund partial scholarships to the GRC.&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXfmliXsQ3DFO0f435DBG24VICC1OKrSc2aXGF3I7YmKFu3Q/viewform?pli=1">Apply here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve attended only a few GRCs since they first started happening two decades ago, when LPFM was first established, and each has been a very positive and energizing experience. Networking and solidarity are keys to the strength of community and college radio, so I strongly recommend it to anyone invested in grassroots radio.</p>

<p>Princeton Review just released its latest college guide, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Best-389-Colleges-2024-Depth/dp/0593516869?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=rsstoretwo-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=251614cd9180651428eefde2daac7836&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 389 Colleges</a> (paid affiliates link) 2024 edition, so it&#8217;s time once again to take a look at its rankings for &#8220;<a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=best-college-radio-station">Best College Radio Station</a>.&#8221; Post-COVID, we are now back to regular annual editions of this list, which is based on student surveys about the popularity of their home school’s radio station. </p>



<p>Like last year, this list is now made up of 25 schools (compared with 20 in the years before COVID). </p>



<p>The 2024 list of the 25 colleges with the “best radio stations” has 19 out of 25 of the schools from the 2023 list. The big surprise this time around, is that Syracuse University dropped from the list. That school, which has several radio stations, has been featured on Princeton Review lists every year since the 2014 edition.</p>



<p>Once again, the list is a mix, including large universities with multiple radio stations as well as small liberal arts colleges with online-only stations. The biggest school on the list is Arizona State (around 65,000 students) and the tiniest is Bennington College (around 785 students). I am also pleased to have visited college radio stations at 6 out of the 25 schools on the list.</p>



<p>The East Coast still dominates. Huge states like California and Texas are not represented at all. The Northeast takes up more of the list than last year, with 16 schools from this region (6 from New York, 3 from New Jersey, 3 from Massachusetts, and 1 each from Maine, Vermont, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania). On the west coast, only 3 schools are represented (2 from Washington and 1 from Oregon). From the Midwest, the 3 schools hail from Minnesota, Michigan, and Ohio. Two schools from the South include one each from Virginia and Florida. And the sole college from the Southwest is from Arizona.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best = Popular</h2>



<p>As a reminder, although the Princeton Review describes its college radio results as “Best College Radio Station,” the title doesn’t tell the whole story. Here’s the skinny:</p>



<p>1. Results are based on student surveys</p>



<p>2. Surveys were conducted at 389 colleges</p>



<p>3. Students are asked to judge the popularity, not the quality, of an unspecified campus radio station at their own college</p>



<p>4. Radio stations are not named in the survey or in the resulting rankings</p>



<p>5. Only schools surveyed can make it into the rankings, so college radio stations at schools that are not surveyed by Princeton Review won’t appear on the list</p>



<p>A number of colleges appearing on the “Best College Radio Station” list have multiple radio stations, including student-run stations, large public radio stations, and everything in between. It makes sense that students would indicate that their school’s radio station is “popular” if they are on a campus with a high profile professional radio station and/or with several radio stations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Digging into Methodology</h2>



<p>According to Princeton Review, “We tallied the rankings lists in the current edition of <em>The Best 389 Colleges</em> (published August 2023), based on the data from our surveys of 165,000 students at the 389 schools in the book.”</p>



<p>The site says that the “Best College Radio Station” list is compiled “based on students’ answers to the survey question, ‘How popular is the college radio station?,” but in recent years, the question was phrased a little differently. For the 2021 edition’s list, the survey asked, “<em>How much do you agree or disagree with the following statements at your school?” </em>Among the list of statements was: <em>“College Radio Station is popular.” </em>Respondents were given the following options:<em> Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neither Agree or Disagree, Agree or Strongly Agree.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1501699323692_37177">How Similar is this Year’s List to Prior Lists?</h2>



<p>For the 2024 Princeton Review list of “Best College Radio Stations,” 19 of the 25 schools were on the 2023 list. <strong>Mount Holyoke College</strong> and <strong>Sarah Lawrence College</strong> are the brand new entrants. Neither has appeared during the 15+ years that I&#8217;ve been tracking Princeton Review lists. The other four schools that did not appear last year include Skidmore College (last appeared on 2022 list), Rider University (last appeared on 2016 list), Wellesley College (last appeared on 2012 list), and Fordham University (last appeared on 2022 list). I love seeing that women&#8217;s colleges (Mount Holyoke and Wellesley and former women&#8217;s colleges (Skidmore and Sarah Lawrence) are taking up a bigger slice of the list this year!</p>



<p>Those that fell off the list this year were Northeastern University, Pace University, Chapman University, University of the South, Syracuse University and Carleton College.</p>

<p><a href="https://metv.fm"><br>MeTV FM</a>&nbsp;and 13 other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2016/07/brief-history-backdoor-frankenfm-radio-stations/">FrankenFM stations</a>&nbsp;now have an official and permanent home on the far left end of the FM dial.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2023/07/frankenfms-up-for-final-vote-at-fcc/">Like I expected</a>, on July 20 the FCC approved&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-23-58A1.pdf">a report and order</a>&nbsp;allowing these now-digital low-power TV channel 6 stations to keep their experimental analog radio transmitters on the air.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a very narrow ruling, premitting only these 14 stations that had received&nbsp;<a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2021/06/its-alive-fcc-authorizes-last-minute-franken-fm-experiment/">Special Temporary Authority (STA) to broadcast an analog radio signal</a>&nbsp;alongside a digital TV signal. No new stations can apply, and the FCC is not otherwise opening up new FM station opportunitieis on 87.75 MHz FM. However, if these stations are sold, they may transfer their FM rights as part of the sale. This had been prohibited under the terms of the STA.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2022/06/fccs-proposal-to-legitimize-frankenfms-proves-it-isnt-in-the-business-of-taking-stations-off-the-air/">As I argued last year</a>, the fact that the Commission would even consider letting these loophole stations keep their loophole permanently is evidence that, despite its flaws and contradictions, the FCC tends to see its role as keeping stations on air and maintaining public service. Critically, FrankenFMs always operated within the letter of the law. They only, “took advantage of the physics of their location on the broadcast television band, because the uppermost portion of the channel where these television stations made their home was also capable of reception on the lowermost portion of the FM radio dial,” as Chairwoman Rosenworcel puts it.</p>



<p>Some might say my argument is contractied by how the FCC treats unlicensed, pirate broadcasters, which in many cases may be providing equivalent public service. Like it or not, unlicensed statoins operate in contravention to the rules, and it’s a critical difference for the FCC, and its legal mandates. This doesn’t mean there couldn’t be more productive approaches to pirate radio – indeed LPFM was one – but it does explain why FrankenFMs received different treament.</p>



<p>Adherence to rules is also why the FCC fines licensed stations that break them, even if those fines might jeopardize the station’s viability. However, in reality, it’s extremely rare that the FCC fines a station off the air for routine violations – even indecency – and the Commission will reduce fines if a license holder demonstrates hardship. Again, in the spirit of keeping stations on air and maintaining public service. If a station leaves the air in the face of a fine, more often it’s because the license holder chooses to sell or transfer the license in order to avoid current and future liability. The license and signal is preserved, even if the specific programming changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In any event, it’s been a long, <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2009/06/analog-tv-is-alive-its-radio/">14-year saga</a> for FrankenFMs.</p>

<p>Jennifer, our intrepid radio station tour guide, leads us through some of her recent visits to college radio stations in New York and Rhode Island. This most recent academic year (2022-23) was an active one, with college campuses and radio stations coming back to life as pandemic restrictions have eased. We also discuss a long-running college radio program that just turned 50 years old. We are curious if listeners know of other programs of a similar vintage. We close the show with a discussion of the 20th anniversary of podcasting.</p>

<p><br>Thanks to James Cridland at <a href="https://podnews.net/update/podcast-20th-birthday-history">Podnews</a>, I was reminded that today, July 9, 2023, marks the 20th birthday of the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2003/07/31/chrisLydonsWeblogForTheEar.html">first-ever podcast recording</a>. As James notes, this was the day that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer">Dave Winer</a> – author of the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt">enclosure tag</a> added to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> to make it possible to automatically download an audio file – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030802082147/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/lydon/2003/07/09">recorded the first episode</a> of what would become <a href="https://radioopensource.org/">Radio Open Source</a>, hosted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lydon">Christopher Lydon</a>. The show is still heard on the radio and <a href="https://radioopensource.org/happy-birthday-to-us/">via podcast today</a>. </p>



<p>Though on-demand radio show audio had been posted to the internet for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2020/07/podcast-255-geek-of-the-week-and-the-beginning-of-internet-radio/">at least a decade prior</a>, podcasting as we know it was born when RSS made it possible to build applications – once called “podcatchers” – to automatically check for new episodes of a show and download them, as we do today using platforms like Apple Podcasts and Spotify. That was the birth of the “podcast feed” that you could subscribe to, so that you didn’t have to check a website to see if a new show was posted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I remember doing just that before 2003, to catch both broadcast and internet radio shows. I was on the other side, too, posting my community radio program, “<a href="http://radio.mediageek.net">mediageek</a>” for non-local and time-shifted listening.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’d already been using RSS to keep tabs on my favorite blogs, pre-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader">Google Reader</a> (R.I.P.), and was excited for the system to gain the capacity to distribute audio. At the time, a lot of online audio was still distributed by proprietary and often expensive streaming systems like RealAudio, frequently beyond the reach of community and grassroots producers. I immediately understood the potential for RSS to make it easier for producers and listeners, alike. Note that we didn’t yet call this a “podcast.” Writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Hammersley">Ben Hammersley</a> wouldn’t coin the term for another year.</p>



<p>I hand coded my first podcast feed – adding the enclosure tag to an existing RSS feed – somewhere in late 2003. Any evidence of that site and files is lost to several server and platform migrations. By 2004 blogging platforms started making it easier to add enclosure tags, so my radio show could now be subscribed to as a podcast. Those episodes are still online (though migrated to WordPress towards the end of the decade).</p>



<p>I didn’t become a regular podcast listener until some time in 2004. At the time you either listened to shows on your PC, or downloaded them to portable media player, such as the medium’s namesake iPod. Smartphones as we know them didn’t exist, and few people had mobile internet. iPods and MP3 players were not internet devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having never owned an iPod, I actually used my minidisc recorder (incidentally, Lydon also used a minidisc recorder in his portable &#8220;<a href="https://www.blogaudio.org/lydon/studio.html">blog audio studio</a>&#8220;). The NetMD feature let you connect it via USB to a PC and download audio to it. It was about as fast as downloading to an iPod, and a disc could hold up to four hours using the new long-play modes. This still meant you also had to plan ahead for your listening. I would often load up a disc the night before so I would have something to listen to on my next day’s commute. Discs were re-writeable, so I would just reuse the same ones over and over. </p>



<p>The real magic of podcasting being built on RSS is that it isn’t owned and controlled by any one entity. It’s an open protocol. Anyone can build a podcast feed and submit it to a directory like Apple Podcasts or Spotify. But even if it’s not in a directory, a listener can get the feed URL and pop it into many&nbsp;<a href="https://podnews.net/article/new-podcast-apps">a podcast player app</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It means that a podcaster is not dependent on a single platform, like YouTube, TikTok, Twitch or Instagram. You just need an account with a web host, or a podcast-specific host. If you need to change that host, most provide pretty simple tools to export and migrate your content. Though, it’s highly recommended to also keep your own backups. Because podcasting isn’t just on one site, it can require a little more technical expertise than just hitting record on an app – even so, some hosts make that simple. But the payoff is that the whims of any one corporation are less likely to shut you down.</p>



<p>That said, I have to acknowlege that the definition of “podcast” is getting broader these days. There are plenty of shows on YouTube or Twitch that creators and consumers consider to be podcasts, that may not be distributed by RSS or available on any audio podcast platform. With the death of the iPod and a growing dependence on large social media platforms, the techical roots of podcasting have become obscured. So the term seems to have become more about the form than the technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though I’m still a strong advocate for the open ecosystem that RSS creates for podcasting, I’m not pedantic about it either. Instead, I’m amazed by how podcasting revitalized talk audio programming and nutured a widely diverse universe of programs across the internet. If someone sees their YouTube channel as a podcast I don’t want to argue with them. To me that’s too much like gatekeeping. Instead, I would like to introduce them to the wider world of the medium, so they might have the knowledge to become less dependent on any one platform, and possibly embrace distributing their show via RSS, in addition to YouTube.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Podcasting’s decentralized nature may have slowed its growth, really not becoming particularly mainstream until its 10th birthday. But rapid growth isn’t necessarily the best possible outcome. Being decentralized means a single billionaire can’t entirely take it over and bend it to his will. That’s a feature, not a bug, and has been key to podcasting’s survival. I think it will continue, too.&nbsp;</p>
