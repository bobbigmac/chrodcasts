			<itunes:subtitle>The Flood of Grace</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Ray Bollas</itunes:author>
			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Summary: We see in our passage today the word “dispensation, (Greek: oikonomia ), it is where we get our word “Economy” .  A lot of people struggle with this word, and theologians come up with books upon books to explain it, but it simply means a “set order of how things work.” God saying I’m setting the order of how things are going to work and nothing can change it.  Satan, evilness, terrorism, prosperity, will not change my plan, or how I run my plan, and it will all happen in the “fullness of time, on my timetable (remember 1:10).  Paul will show in these verses that the fullness of time has come, and the church is now in the period “of the grace of God.”&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

			<title>Ephesians 2:11-22</title>
			<itunes:subtitle>God Wants You</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Ray Bollas</itunes:author>
			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Summary: You are the dwelling place of God!  The Holy God, dwells in you, and if you are wondering what all the means listen on as we study what that means.  As we have said in a prior study, there are only 3 things that matter in real estate, and every real estate agent confirms….. location, location, location.  When looking for a place to live, dwell, the number one thing is always location…… this is where I want to live. Whether it is one reason or a thousand reasons, we come to the place of….. this is where I want to live.  God, the creator of the universe, He who sits upon the throne, wants to live with you and in you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does just that thought make you feel today?  How long has it been since you “remembered that”?  When we find the perfect house, we say I want this house, I am willing to buy this house, because I really want this house.  God wants you.  Maybe you don’t feel wanted, maybe you feel second in everyone’s life, maybe it isn’t even a felling but a demonstrated fact, that you are second, or a demonstrated fact that you are unwanted.  BUT GOD….. says to you today in this passage, I want you!  &lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Summary: Surely, we have reached the summit of the New Testament here in this passage.  Our passage today summarizes the greatest gift (everlasting salvation), from the greatest lover (God’s own heart), and God’s greatest thoughts of you (His masterpiece).  When, if we, can fully comprehend what is declared to us in these verses, we will live in power, we will live in peace, we will be secure in our salvation, and secure in our identity (not just in the life to come, but the life here now), we will walk a walk that nothing in this world can move or diminish.  Oh, what a passage that is before us today.&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

			<title>Ephesians 2:1-7</title>
			<itunes:subtitle>Our Past, Present, and Future (Amazing)</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Ray Bollas</itunes:author>
			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Summary: From dead in sin to seated with Christ in heavenly places—what a transformation! This Sunday we explored Ephesians 2:1-7 and discovered the breathtaking reality of our past, present, and future in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were once dead in trespasses and sins, walking according to the world&apos;s standards. But God—those two powerful words change everything! Rich in mercy and great in love, He made us alive together with Christ. Not only alive, but raised up and seated with Him in heavenly places. You are God&apos;s trophy of grace, His inheritance, loved before the foundation of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s the beautiful truth: His kindness leads us to repentance, not our dwelling on failures. God is patting the seat next to Him, saying &quot;Come sit here with Me.&quot; For all eternity, He wants to show you the exceeding riches of His grace. That&apos;s not just your future—that&apos;s your reality today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change the way you think. Live like you&apos;re called.

			<itunes:subtitle>Using God’s Promises in Our Daily Walk</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Ray Bollas</itunes:author>
			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Summary: The Book of Ephesians is about all the spiritual riches available to the believer. Ephesians 1:3 the theme of the whole book says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: For the first fourteen verses the Apostle Paul talks about how we are &quot;born spiritually rich&quot; when we trusted Christ.  But he says that being born spiritually rich is not enough, for we must grow in our understanding of our riches if we are ever going to use them to the glory of God.  God desired that the Christians in Ephesus understood what great spiritual wealth they had in Christ.   After talking about Knowledge is Power through the first 14 verses, Paul goes and starts to pray for them that they would seize this Knowledge and have the Power to use in their daily walk.  Two thousand years later, God desires the same for us today.&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

			<title>The Seal</title>
			<itunes:subtitle>Ephesians 1:11-14</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Ray Bollas</itunes:author>
			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Summary: God Seals Us when we believe. Why does this passage of scripture matter to you today?  Well quite simply, if a person continually struggles with what is their purpose and worth in life, and if they continually struggle with their eternal security, they will never be able to move on and live in the victorious Christian life that God purposes for them, and promises for them to have for the taking.  And notice, I say for the taking, because although God purposes it and secures it for the Believer, the believer still must take it by their own freewill choosing. &lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

			<itunes:subtitle>Redemption Puts the Broken Pieces Back Together</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Ray Bollas</itunes:author>
			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Summary: Life has a way of leaving us in pieces. Relationships fracture. Dreams shatter. Sin separates. From the moment humanity fell in the Garden of Eden, the story of our existence has been one of things falling apart—man separated from God, brother against brother, nation against nation. Yet woven throughout Scripture is a counter-narrative, a divine promise that what has been broken will be made whole again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the heart of redemption.&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

			<title>The Chosen</title>
			<itunes:subtitle>Ephesians 1:3-4</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Ray Bollas</itunes:author>
			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Summary: This week&apos;s sermon from Ephesians 1:3-4 explores the incredible truth that we have been chosen by God and blessed with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ. We discover that our identity as saints is not something we earn through our efforts, but rather a position we occupy because of God&apos;s perfect love. The sermon challenges us to move from earthly thinking to heavenly thinking - to stop living like spiritual paupers when we have unlimited riches available to us in Christ. Just as God moved the fence to bring us into His presence, He has secured our position once and for all, declaring us holy and without blame before Him in love.&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

			<itunes:subtitle>The Prophetic Blessings: Jacob&apos;s Final Words to His Sons</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Ray Bollas</itunes:author>
			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Summary: There&apos;s something profoundly moving about a father&apos;s final words to his children. When Jacob gathered his twelve sons around his deathbed in Egypt, he didn&apos;t simply say goodbye. He spoke prophetically over each one, revealing their character, their destiny, and the future of the nation that would spring from their lineage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This moment, recorded in Genesis 49, is far more than an ancient family gathering. It&apos;s a window into God&apos;s sovereign plan—a plan that stretches from paradise lost to paradise restored, from the garden of Eden to the coming Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Summary: Jacob&apos;s story is one of transformation. The deceiver became Israel, the prince with God. The schemer became the blesser. His final years in Egypt were marked by faith, maturity, and anticipation of God&apos;s promises. Your best chapter is yet to come. God is still working, still refining, still conforming you to the image of His Son. Be confident of this: He who began a good work in you will complete it (Philippians 1:6). So go into the world as Jacob went into Pharaoh&apos;s court. Speak blessing over the powerful and the powerless alike. Place God&apos;s name upon everyone you meet. And watch as He transforms both them and you in the process. You are a stranger and pilgrim here—but you carry the authority of heaven. Use it to bless.&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

They are shocked, and of course fearful for their sin has found them out, and they stand before Joseph who has the power to punish them to death if he so choses. But Joseph will say to them, don&apos;t be grieved. Don&apos;t be troubled. In essence he is saying, I forgive you, I love you, I don&apos;t hold anything against you; so be free in these words that I give you so that we can have a relationship, be a family again, and be one. In this study we will see what a man/woman, who walks with God, does. This is who a man/woman... who sees themselves in light of who God is….. and what and how they respond…… they respond like God.&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

When you do receive it, it will be as a kiss of God, for mercy is the heart of God. Mercy…. ever give it? When you do, it will be the very heart of God to the brokenhearted. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

While only one chapter is devoted to the creation of the universe, God chose to dedicate a significant portion to Joseph&apos;s life. This emphasis begs the question: Why?

			<title>Genesis 32-33</title>
			<itunes:subtitle>A Broken Man</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Ray Bollas</itunes:author>
			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Summary: In Genesis 32, Jacob faces a moment of deep fear and crisis as he prepares to meet his brother Esau, whom he had wronged years earlier. Overwhelmed by anxiety, Jacob prays humbly, acknowledging his unworthiness and pleading for God’s deliverance. That night, alone and desperate, Jacob wrestles with a mysterious man—God Himself in human form. In this struggle, Jacob is physically broken, his hip put out of joint, yet he clings in faith, refusing to let go without a blessing. God renames him Israel (which means “Governed by God”), marking the transformation of Jacob from a self-reliant schemer to a man dependent on God’s grace.&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Summary: In Genesis 32, Jacob faces a moment of deep fear and crisis as he prepares to meet his brother Esau, whom he had wronged years earlier. Overwhelmed by anxiety, Jacob prays humbly, acknowledging his unworthiness and pleading for God’s deliverance. That night, alone and desperate, Jacob wrestles with a mysterious man—God Himself in human form. In this struggle, Jacob is physically broken, his hip put out of joint, yet he clings in faith, refusing to let go without a blessing.

			<itunes:subtitle>All the Promises of God are Yes and Amen!</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Ray Bollas</itunes:author>
			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Summary: It is 25-years later, but here is the promise given to Abraham and Sarah fulfilled with the birth of Issac. The child of promise is Issac, and his name means laughter. Surely people laughed at the impossibility of having a child at such an age; but now we will read they laugh with them, in the amazement of what only God can do. He is the same God today…. And people may be laughing at what you say God is going to do in your life, but someday they will be laughing with you in amazement saying ….. He did it!&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

And, if Abram wanted to know God’s power, he had to walk, that is live, close to the Lord. So too the passage before us speaks the same unto us. How can we do it?

			<itunes:subtitle>Nothing</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Ray Bollas</itunes:author>
			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Summary: The title of this study is “nothing”, and when asked what we studied, we will say “nothing”. And the “nothing” that we will study and apply to our lives personally is that Abraham did “nothing” to be chosen and called by God. There was “nothing” in or about Abraham that made him chosen; it was all God’s grace to call him. Therefore, as we study the life of Abraham in the chapters to come, and we see time of great faith, along with times of great failings, we can remember that “nothing” can keep us from the love of God, because “nothing” was the reason God called us to Himself except His great love. &lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

			<itunes:author>Pastor Ray Bollas</itunes:author>
			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Summary: The word revelation means to unveil, to make known, yet many people can think this book is hard to understand; on the contrary, the Lord’s whole purpose is for us to understand it (reveal it to us). So much so God promises us a blessing (1:3) if we read it. The Book of Revelation is the only book in the Bible that comes with such a promise.
