In this message from Pastor John Lindell, we see how Jacob’s encounter with God shows us the power of personal surrender, persistent faith, and allowing God to transform us from the inside out. Our prayer is that as you step into a new year, you would choose to meet with God, hold onto Him in faith, and experience the life-changing blessing that comes through transformation.]]></itunes:summary>

Drawing from 2 Samuel 24 and 1 Chronicles 21, this message shows how King David’s decision to take a census exposed the danger of self-reliance, the ripple effects of sin, but ultimately, the mercy that follows genuine repentance and sacrificial worship. Our prayer is that you’ll trade counting for trusting, repent quickly, and bring God a costly, obedient worship that invites His mercy and fire into your life.</p>
