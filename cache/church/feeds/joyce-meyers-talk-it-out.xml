Yeah, that's for them, not me.</em></p> <p><em>My bad decisions got me here—I deserve this pain.</em></p> <p>Any of these thoughts sound familiar? When we're going through deep pain and loss, it's easy to think that we're past hope and beyond God's love, but nothing could be further from the truth.
