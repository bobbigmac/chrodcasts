Its roots date back to before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War&quot;&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_by_the_Riverside#cite_note-why_freedom-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; though it was first published in 1918 in Plantation Melodies: A Collection of Modern, Popular and Old-time Negro-Songs of the Southland, Chicago, the Rodeheaver Company.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_by_the_Riverside#cite_note-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; The song has alternatively been known as “Ain' go'n' to study war no mo'”, “Ain't Gwine to Study War No More”, “Down by de Ribberside”, “Going to Pull My War-Clothes” and “Study war no more”. The song was first recorded by the Fisk University Jubilee Quartet in 1920 (published by Columbia in 1922). and there are at least 14 black gospel recordings before World War II.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_by_the_Riverside#cite_note-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The song's central image is of casting off negativity and aggression, and putting on spiritual garb, at the side of a river before crossing it. The image has several meanings: it refers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism&quot;&gt;baptism&lt;/a&gt;, which in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist&quot;&gt;Southern Baptist&lt;/a&gt; tradition usually involves wearing a white robe and being submerged in a body of water. It also refers to ascending to heaven after death, using the metaphor of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Jordan&quot;&gt;River Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, which in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament&quot;&gt;Old Testament&lt;/a&gt; was the final passage before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrews&quot;&gt;Hebrews&lt;/a&gt; entered the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promised_Land&quot;&gt;Promised Land&lt;/a&gt; after their years in the desert.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_by_the_Riverside#cite_note-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; As with many Negro spirituals, the biblical imagery can also be read as a hidden allusion to escaping &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States&quot;&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt;, with the river representing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_River&quot;&gt;Ohio River&lt;/a&gt;, which was a border between states where slavery was allowed and prohibited before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War&quot;&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_by_the_Riverside#cite_note-5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The refrain of &amp;quot;ain't gonna study war no more&amp;quot; is a reference to a quotation found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament&quot;&gt;Old Testament&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_by_the_Riverside#cite_note-why_freedom-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; This quote occurs twice in the Bible, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://tools.wmflabs.org/bibleversefinder/?book=Isaiah&amp;verse=2:4&amp;src=KJV&quot;&gt;Isaiah 2:4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  and &lt;a href=&quot;http://tools.wmflabs.org/bibleversefinder/?book=Micah&amp;verse=4:3&amp;src=KJV&quot;&gt;Micah 4:3&lt;/a&gt; , and is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swords_to_ploughshares&quot;&gt;swords to ploughshares&lt;/a&gt; motif.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;G&lt;br/&gt;I'm gonna lay down my burden&lt;br/&gt;                      &lt;br/&gt;Down by the riverside &lt;br/&gt;D7&lt;br/&gt;Down by the riverside&lt;br/&gt;G&lt;br/&gt;Down by the riverside&lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;I'm gonna lay down my burden&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Down by the riverside&lt;br/&gt;      D7           G&lt;br/&gt;Gonna study war no more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;              C&lt;br/&gt;I ain't gonna study war no more&lt;br/&gt;              G&lt;br/&gt;I ain't gonna study war no more&lt;br/&gt;              D7        G&lt;br/&gt;I ain't gonna study war no&lt;br/&gt;              C&lt;br/&gt;I ain't gonna study war no more&lt;br/&gt;              G&lt;br/&gt;I ain't gonna study war no more&lt;br/&gt;              D7           G&lt;br/&gt;I ain't gonna study war no more&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;G&lt;br/&gt;I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Down by the riverside&lt;br/&gt;D7&lt;br/&gt;Down by the riverside&lt;br/&gt;G&lt;br/&gt;Down by the riverside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Down by the riverside&lt;br/&gt;      D7           G  &lt;br/&gt;Gonna study war no more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Repeat #2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gonna meet my loving Savior&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Down by the riverside&lt;br/&gt;D7&lt;br/&gt;Down by the riverside&lt;br/&gt;G&lt;br/&gt;Down by the riverside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gonna meet my dear Savior&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Down by the riverside&lt;br/&gt;      D7           G &lt;br/&gt;Gonna study war no more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sound recording and arrangement © 2016 Shiloh Worship Music COPY FREELY;This Music is copyrighted to prevent misuse, however,permission is granted for non-commercial copying-Radio play permitted- www.shilohworshipmusic.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
