In this message from Pastor John Lindell, we see how Jacob’s encounter with God shows us the power of personal surrender, persistent faith, and allowing God to transform us from the inside out. Our prayer is that as you step into a new year, you would choose to meet with God, hold onto Him in faith, and experience the life-changing blessing that comes through transformation.]]></itunes:summary>

In this message from Lead Pastor John Lindell, we’re reminded that God’s thoughts and ways are higher than ours, and that many times His answers don’t look like what we imagined—even though they are exactly what we need. Our prayer is that as you listen, you’ll learn to lay down your expectations, recognize God’s supernatural provision, and embrace the opportunities He’s placing in front of you as His unique answers to your prayers.]]></description>

In this message, Pastor David Lindell teaches from Acts 20:35 and Isaiah 32:8 that generosity isn’t about what you have, but who you are.

What causes rebellion to grow in the heart?
 
This message looks at the life of Absalom and shows how rebellion develops through indulgent parenting, suppressed anger, isolation, obsession with image, undermining authority, and the desire for control. Our prayer is that you will learn to recognize these patterns and choose instead the freedom and peace that come from walking in God’s ways.
