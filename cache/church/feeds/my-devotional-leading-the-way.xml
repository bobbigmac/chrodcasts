      <title>Freedom from Pessimism</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Have you been stuck expecting the worst—even in your walk with God?</p><p>Over the last few days, we’ve been confronting pessimism through the life of Thomas, the disciple forever nicknamed “doubting Thomas.” But Dr. Michael Youssef reveals the deeper issue beneath Thomas’ doubt—and ours: <strong>a distorted understanding of who Jesus truly is</strong>. With patient love, Christ led Thomas from skepticism to victory, and that same resurrection power can transform you too.</p><p>In this episode of the <strong>MY Devotional Podcast</strong>, you’ll discover:</p><p>why doubt often grows from an incomplete view of Christ,</p><p>how Jesus personally frees us from pessimism, and</p><p>what genuine transformation looks like after we encounter the living Savior.</p><p>Thomas’ change wasn’t merely intellectual—it reshaped his entire life. After meeting the risen Christ, he became bold and mission-minded, taking the Gospel into difficult regions such as Nineveh and India. Dr. Youssef reminds us that when we truly grasp God’s calling and His unconditional love, pessimism gives way to Spirit-empowered hope—<strong>pessimistic to visionary, uncertain to confident, and hopeless to joyful</strong>.</p><p>If you’re tired of negative “what ifs,” chronic doubt, or spiritual hesitation, this devotional will point you back to the One who has the final word over every fear:</p><blockquote><p>“So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed” (John 8:36).</p></blockquote><p><strong>Scripture Focus:</strong> John 8:36</p>

      <title>God Overpowers Our Pessimism</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you ever feel your faith shrink after a setback—like hope is slipping through your fingers?</p><p>In this episode of the <strong>MY Devotional Podcast</strong>, Dr. Michael Youssef continues the journey of overcoming pessimism by revealing the next steps toward steady confidence in Christ. While yesterday’s foundation was knowing who you are in Jesus, today tackles what happens when fear, opposition, or disappointment hits your “hot buttons” and you start expecting the worst.</p><p>Through the life of <strong>Thomas</strong>, Dr. Youssef highlights how Jesus overpowers pessimism in real time:</p><p><strong>How to handle setbacks without losing confidence</strong> (John 11): Thomas assumed following Jesus to Bethany would end in death—but Jesus shattered that fear by raising Lazarus, proving His authority even over the grave.</p><p><strong>How Christ’s resurrection defeats chronic doubt</strong> (John 20:25–28): Thomas demanded proof—until the risen Jesus stood before him. Encountering the living Christ transformed him from skeptic to worshiper: <i>“My Lord and my God!”</i></p><p><strong>Why your hope is never tied to circumstances</strong>: Jesus is alive, reigning at the right hand of the Father, and still redeeming situations that look beyond repair.</p><p>If you’ve been bracing for disappointment, stuck in “realistic” negativity, or quietly wondering if God will come through—this devotional will help you remember what Thomas learned firsthand: <strong>the resurrected Christ changes what’s possible.</strong></p><p><strong>Scripture Focus:</strong> Psalm 66:5</p>

      <title>Overcoming Pessimism with God’s Love</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Pessimism is one of the quietest threats to a growing faith—because it often sounds like wisdom. We rename it “discernment,” “caution,” or “being realistic,” but Scripture exposes what it truly is: <strong>a lack of faith in God’s power or His promises</strong>.</p><p>In this episode of the <strong>MY Devotional Podcast</strong>, Dr. Michael Youssef takes you to <strong>Mark 9</strong>, where a desperate father says to Jesus, “If you can…”—revealing the real issue wasn’t Jesus’ ability, but the father’s unbelief. Christ’s reply still challenges us today: <strong>faith changes what we believe is possible</strong>.</p><p>Dr. Youssef also points to <strong>Thomas</strong>, famously labeled “doubting Thomas,” to show that pessimism doesn’t have to be permanent. Jesus overcame Thomas’ unbelief by anchoring him in a life-altering truth: <strong>you are chosen, called, and unconditionally loved by God’s grace</strong>.</p><p>If you’ve been battling negativity, doubt, or a constant expectation of the worst, this devotional will help you:</p><p>identify pessimism for what it is,</p><p>bring your unbelief honestly to Jesus, and</p><p>rest in the security of God’s steadfast love and calling.</p><p><strong>Scripture Focus:</strong> 1 John 3:1</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>What are you drawing on for strength—your circumstances, your abilities, or the power of Christ?</p><p>In today’s episode of the <strong>MY Devotional Podcast</strong>, Dr. Michael Youssef reminds us that <strong>only Christ’s resurrection power</strong> can truly satisfy the empty heart, defeat temptation, and exchange our weakness for His strength. Earthly assets and “wins” may look impressive, but they’re nothing compared to the transforming power of Jesus.</p><p>This devotional also sounds a loving warning: when life is going well, it’s easy to drift back into independence and forget the Source of real joy. That’s why we must stay alert to <strong>spiritual stagnation</strong> and choose growth—even when growth stretches us.</p><p>You’ll be encouraged by Scripture’s call to keep pressing forward:</p><p><strong>Run with perseverance</strong>, throwing off sin and fixing your eyes on Jesus (Hebrews 12:1–2).</p><p><strong>Press on toward the goal</strong>, forgetting what’s behind and straining toward what’s ahead (Philippians 3:13–14).</p><p>If you’ve been tempted to coast, quit, or rely on comfort instead of Christ, this episode will re-center your heart on the One whose power never runs out—and whose grace meets you in the struggle.</p><p><strong>Scripture Focus:</strong> Psalm 147:5</p>

      <title>Staying on the Way of Contentment: February 24, 2026</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Everyone has weaknesses—but not everyone knows what to do with them.</p><p>In this episode of the <strong>MY Devotional Podcast</strong>, Dr. Michael Youssef exposes a subtle trap the enemy uses to keep believers restless: <strong>refusing to confront our weaknesses</strong>. Whether your struggle is physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual, unresolved weakness can breed discontentment and quietly drain your joy—unless you apply God’s grace to the very places that hurt.</p><p>Dr. Youssef takes you to Paul’s “thorn in the flesh” and the breakthrough lesson God taught him:</p><blockquote><p>“My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9).</p></blockquote><p>You’ll discover why the most important part of any trial isn’t the struggle itself—but <strong>how you respond to it</strong>. If you’ve ever felt like God’s grace “isn’t enough,” this episode helps you diagnose what’s really happening: either you’re fixated on the problem instead of His grace, or you’re avoiding the issue entirely. The way forward is not denial or despair—it’s honest dependence on Christ.</p><p>You’ll also be reminded that Jesus is not distant from your struggle. He understands your weakness with compassion—and He invites you to come to Him for strength and mercy (Hebrews 4:15).</p><p><strong>Scripture Focus:</strong> 2 Corinthians 12:9</p>

      <title>Sufficient Grace: February 22, 2026</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Has “grace” lost its wonder?</p><p>In this episode of the <strong>MY Devotional Podcast</strong>, Dr. Michael Youssef challenges the modern misconceptions that have watered grace down into mere politeness—or made it unnecessary in an age of self-sufficiency and “rights.” The Truth is far more stunning: we are sinners who could never earn our way back to God. Only Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross and His righteousness credited to us can justify us before the Father (see John 3:16).</p><p>Dr. Youssef then brings this Gospel reality into your everyday battles. When trials hit, anxiety rises, or temptation threatens your fellowship with God, grace becomes more than a doctrine—it becomes your lifeline. Through prayer, God steadies you with peace and security, goes before you into life’s battles, and provides victory that doesn’t come from your strength, but from His.</p><p>If you’re facing pressure, fear, or exhaustion, this devotional will lift your eyes to the promise you can cling to today: <strong>God’s grace is sufficient—and His power is revealed in your weakness.</strong></p><p><strong>Scripture Focus:</strong> Psalm 20:7</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>What does the grace of God really mean for your life today?</p><p>In this powerful episode of the MY Devotional Podcast, Dr. Michael Youssef unpacks the life-changing Truth of God’s pursuing grace—from the Garden of Eden to your present struggles. Before grace, we were spiritually dead, enslaved to sin, and powerless to change. But through the Gospel of Jesus Christ, God entered the scene—not merely to impress us with His omnipotence, but to rescue us from eternal death and bring us into abundant life (John 1:16).</p><p>Drawing from the sweeping narrative of Scripture and the transforming power of the Holy Spirit, Dr. Youssef reminds us:</p><p>God’s grace awakens the spiritually dead.</p><p>God’s grace empowers us to overcome sin’s strongholds.</p><p>God’s grace sustains us when we stray.</p><p>God’s grace assures us of eternal hope.</p><p>Even when we falter, the Lord remains steadfast—the “Hound of Heaven,” faithfully pursuing His children. Through Christ, we are not merely survivors of sin’s battle—we are conquerors.</p><p>If you are struggling with guilt, spiritual apathy, or discouragement, this devotional will anchor your heart in the unchanging grace of God and call you to renewed surrender to the Spirit’s work in your life.</p><blockquote><p>“Out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given” (John 1:16).</p></blockquote><p>Listen now and rediscover the awe-inspiring grace that saves, sanctifies, and secures you for eternity.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you’re trying to grow closer to Jesus and keep hitting resistance, you’re not alone—and you’re not failing. In today’s MY Devotional, Dr. Michael Youssef shows why obstacles are part of the journey of faith and how your response to them can either stifle spiritual growth or strengthen it.</p><p>You’ll learn the three common blockers that quietly weaken intimacy with Christ:</p><p><strong>An inability to accept correction</strong> — A teachable heart is a clear sign of maturity. How you respond when a godly believer points out blind spots reveals a lot about your love for Jesus.</p><p><strong>An unwillingness to change</strong> — Sanctification means continual growth. The moment we stop changing, we step into spiritual danger.</p><p><strong>Confusing the journey for the destination</strong> — Are you living as a citizen of this world with a passing interest in heaven, or as a citizen of heaven passing through this world? (Philippians 3:20–21)</p><p>This episode will help you reframe spiritual resistance, recognize what’s holding you back, and pursue Jesus with renewed focus—right where you are.</p><p><strong>Scripture Focus:</strong> Colossians 1:9–10</p>

      <title>Longing for More of Jesus: February 18th, 2026</title>

In this timely teaching from Revelation 2-3, Dr. Youssef leads you through important warnings and uplifting encouragements from Christ Himself delivered in His seven letters to the seven churches of Revelation—words just as relevant today as they were to the first-century church.

      <title>Facing a Crossroads: November 28, 2024</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In 1 Kings 18, we see that Israel was at a crossroads. They had lost their awe of God. To them, He was a million miles away. They still claimed to follow Jehovah, but He was no longer a part of their daily lives. God knew that only a vivid reminder of His power would awaken these people from their spiritual sleep. So God used Elijah to bring about a turning point in their lives. In today’s devotional, Dr. Michael Youssef looks at Elijah’s powerful confrontation with the pagan prophets.   </p><p>If you would like more insight into today’s devotional topic, listen to Dr. Michael Youssef’s sermon <i>How God Works, Part 4</i>: <a href="https://www.ltw.org/listen/teaching/series/how-god-works/part-4">LISTEN NOW</a></p><p><strong>AVAILABLE NOW FOR YOUR GIFT OF ANY AMOUNT</strong></p><p>Today, you can learn to release your fears and be filled with the abiding peace of Christ.</p><p>The trials of this world prompt us to run for shelter and sanctuary.

      <title>A Warning Against Sin: November 7, 2024</title>

      <title>Life Goes Better with Praise: October 3, 2024</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>When Daniel and his friends were taken captive to Babylon, they found themselves in a world completely unlike their own. Even their names were changed to align with the pagan culture around them. Facing pressure to conform and worship false gods, it would have been easy for them to give in and lose their true identity. In today’s devotional, Dr. Michael Youssef explores how Daniel resisted an oppressive society, encouraging Christ followers today to stand firm in their identity in Christ.</p><p>If you would like more insight into today’s devotional topic, watch or listen to Dr. Michael Youssef’s sermon series <i>Discover the Power of One</i>: <a href="https://www.ltw.org/listen/teaching/series/discover-the-power-of-one/part-1">LISTEN NOW</a> | <a href="https://www.ltw.org/watch/teaching/series/discover-the-power-of-one/part-1">WATCH NOW</a></p><p><strong>AVAILABLE NOW FOR YOUR GIFT OF ANY AMOUNT</strong></p><p>Do you know where to turn in the midst of brokenness?

As you experience David’s most desperate cries in the Psalms, you’ll witness the power of a life completely surrendered to God.

      <title>Bully Nebuchadnezzar: September 23, 2024</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Almost everyone can remember at least one bully from school—especially if they shoved you on the playground, teased people relentlessly, or threatened and manipulated others.

In today’s devotional, Dr. Michael Youssef evaluates the wise response of Daniel to the bully Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p>If you would like more insight into today’s devotional topic, watch or listen to Dr. Michael Youssef’s sermon series <i>Discover the Power of One, Part 2</i>: <a href="https://www.ltw.org/listen/teaching/series/discover-the-power-of-one/part-2">LISTEN NOW</a> | <a href="https://www.ltw.org/watch/teaching/series/discover-the-power-of-one/part-2">WATCH NOW</a></p><p><strong>AVAILABLE NOW FOR YOUR GIFT OF ANY AMOUNT</strong></p><p>Do you know where to turn in the midst of brokenness?

      <title>Champions Focus on God: August 2, 2024</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The men and women in the Bible who accomplished great things for God's Kingdom had great focus. Though they stumbled along the way, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, and even Samson trained their eyes to stay put on the Lord. In today’s devotional, Dr. Michael Youssef reminds us that focusing on God will help us avoid repeating past failures. </p><p>If you would like more insight into today’s devotional topic, watch or listen to Dr. Michael Youssef’s sermon series <i>A Heart for God</i>: <a href="https://www.ltw.org/watch/teaching/series/a-heart-for-god/part-1">WATCH NOW</a> | <a href="https://www.ltw.org/listen/teaching/series/a-heart-for-god/part-1">LISTEN NOW</a></p><p><strong>AVAILABLE NOW FOR YOUR GIFT OF ANY AMOUNT</strong></p><p>Do you know where to turn in the midst of brokenness? Have you exchanged self-reliance for absolute trust in the living God? </p><p>In <a href="https://store.ltw.org/home"><i>A Heart for God: Lessons from the Life of David</i></a>, Dr. Michael Youssef takes you on a journey through the highs and lows of David’s life. As you explore his greatest victories and deepest failures in First and Second Samuel, you’ll see God’s faithfulness to use willing vessels for His glory. As you experience David’s most desperate cries in the Psalms, you’ll witness the power of a life completely surrendered to God.
