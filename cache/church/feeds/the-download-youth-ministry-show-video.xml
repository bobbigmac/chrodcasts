            <description><![CDATA[<p>unbrokenfilm.com</p>

<p>WHEN THE WAR ENDED, HIS BATTLE BEGAN. Based on Laura Hillenbrand’s bestselling book, UNBROKEN: PATH TO REDEMPTION begins where the hit movie Unbroken concludes, sharing the next amazing chapter of the unbelievable true story of Olympian and World War II hero Louis Zamperini.

Until Cynthia experiences Billy Graham’s 1949 Los Angeles Crusade, where she finds faith in God and a renewed commitment to her marriage and her husband. Now, her most fervent prayer is for God to help Louie find the peace and forgiveness he so desperately needs. In theaters September 14, UNBROKEN: PATH TO REDEMPTION brings to life the rest of this powerful real-life story of forgiveness, redemption, and amazing grace.</p>]]></description>

            <link>http://www.youthministrygarage.com/blog/2012/10/11/episode-199---official-tour-of-the-ym-garage/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[For those viewers who have ever doubted if this podcast was taped in an actual garage - doubt no longer friends. You'll get an exclusive all-access tour of the YM Garage. You'll get a behind-the-scenes look at Doug's old office (some might even say "storage closet"). While this is the shortest episode we've ever taped, it's because we've already begun packing for our trip to San Diego for Show 200 LIVE at YS' NYWC! What a milestone - and we couldn't think of a more fitting way to celebrate it than with a few hundred fellow youth workers as our live studio audience. Enjoy the tour!]]></description>
