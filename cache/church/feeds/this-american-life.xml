 <description>&lt;p&gt;Kids using perfectly logical arguments and arriving at perfectly wrong conclusions.

Ira also talks with Dr. Alison Gopnik, co-author of the book, &quot;The Scientist in the Crib,&quot; about what exactly kid logic is. (6 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act One: More stories like the one in the prologue, where kids look at something going on around them, observe it carefully, think about it logically, and come to conclusions that are completely incorrect. (11 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Two: Michael Chabon reads an excerpt from his short story &quot;Werewolves in Their Youth,&quot; from his collection of the same name, about an act of kid logic that succeeds where adult logic fails. (16 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Three: Howie Chackowicz tried a risky combination when he was little, kid logic with puppy love. He used to think that girls would fall in love with him if they could just see him sleeping or hear him read aloud. He revisits his biggest childhood crush and finds out that not only did his methods not work, but that no one even noticed them. (10 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Four: Alex Blumberg investigates a little-studied phenomenon: Children who get a mistaken idea in their heads about how something works or what something means, and then don&#039;t figure out until well into adulthood that they were wrong. Including the tale of a girl who received a tissue box for Christmas, allegedly painted by trained monkeys. (13 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcripts are available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/605/transcript&quot;&gt;thisamericanlife.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#039;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/page/privacy-policy&#039;&gt;This American Life privacy policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#039;https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices&#039;&gt;Learn more about sponsor message choices.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>75: Kindness of Strangers</title>
 <link>https://www.thisamericanlife.org/kindness-of-strangers</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;An episode from our show&#039;s early days: Stories about what happens when strangers are kind — and when they&#039;re not.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prologue: Brett Leveridge was standing on the subway platform when a man walked by, stopping in front of each passenger to deliver a quiet verdict: &quot;You&#039;re in. You&#039;re out. You can stay. You—gotta go.&quot; Most people ignored him. But Brett found himself hoping for the thumbs up. (5 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act One: New York City locksmith Joel Kostman tells the story of an act of kindness he committed, hoping for a small reward. (13 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Two: In 1940, Jack Geiger, at the age of fourteen, left his middle-class Jewish home and knocked on the door of a Black actor named Canada Lee. He asked Lee if he could move in with him. Lee said yes. In Lee&#039;s Harlem apartment, Geiger spent a year among many of the great figures of the Harlem Renaissance: Langston Hughes, Billy Strayhorn, Richard Wright, Adam Clayton Powell. (11 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Three: How two next-door neighbors start treating each other badly, and how their feud becomes an all-consuming obsession. Paul Tough reports. (14 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Four: For five weeks, a singer named Nick Drakides stood on a stoop in the East Village, singing Sinatra songs late at night to the delight of his neighbors. The cops didn&#039;t bust him; the crowds behaved. It was his gift to New York. Blake Eskin tells the story. (12 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcripts are available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/75/transcript&quot;&gt;thisamericanlife.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#039;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/page/privacy-policy&#039;&gt;This American Life privacy policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#039;https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices&#039;&gt;Learn more about sponsor message choices.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;People discovering information about their own lives that they did not know, and suddenly everything looks very different.

Producer Aviva DeKornfeld talked to Jake about it. (14 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Two: Ben Austen had a kind of new lore drop happen to him recently. But it was not the clarifying kind of lore drop, where everything suddenly makes sense — it was kind of the opposite. (29 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcripts are available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/878/transcript&quot;&gt;thisamericanlife.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#039;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/page/privacy-policy&#039;&gt;This American Life privacy policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#039;https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices&#039;&gt;Learn more about sponsor message choices.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
