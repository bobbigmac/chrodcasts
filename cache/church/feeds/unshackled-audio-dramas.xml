Again sent to labor camp for nearly four years, he is brainwashed and tries to deny God. They release him and he finishes college but is sent to labor camp for another year for listening to English radio to learn English. Still persecuted, he finally meets Chang and they marry; but the persecution continues. As a scholar he goes to the U.S. where other Chinese believers help him see God’s mercy and grace. He recommits his life to Christ, brings his family to the U.S. and goes to seminary. Now a missionary to the Chinese worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Neil is born with congenital glaucoma.  His poor Orthodox Jewish family moves downstate so he can attend the state school for the blind.  There he encounters prejudice but makes a few friends among the black students, who introduce him to boogie-woogie music which becomes a passion.  Because of prejudice about Jews, he decides to study Hebrew and passes his bar mitzvah, planning to be a rabbi.  Liberal teaching ends that interest and he pursues music becoming an accomplished piano player.  Because he is overweight and blind, no girls are interested in him.  He graduates and goes to college, meeting Christians who take him to church.  He doesn’t drink or use drugs but he becomes an “atheist”, playing in nightclubs.  The first part ends when his mother dies.&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;“Hafiz” is born into an Orthodox Muslim family and memorizes the Quran.  At fifteen he finds a Christian pamphlet and compares the Bible to the Quran.  He believes in Jesus and his family throws him out.  The persecution continues; he goes to a Christian tech school, returns to his home town and his family tries to kill him with poison.  He recovers and begins traveling from one country to another—is jailed in Syria for possessing Bibles.  There he helps a fellow prisoner who has converted to Islam out of fear.

			<title>2826 James Wendorf Classic</title>
			<itunes:subtitle>Airplanes, Warships, Fast Cars</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:author></itunes:author>
			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Airplanes, warships, fast cars and other hazards nearly cost Jim Wendorf his life as a young officer in the Navy, and are part of the story of how this respected Wisconsin lawyer came to see he was not ‘just lucky’ or leading a charmed life – but that God had a purpose for keeping him alive through all these hazards.  That purpose has been richly realized once he faced his life squarely and realized he wasn’t going to make it to heaven or escape hell just on will-power or luck.  Jim Wendorf came to the place – by God’s grace – he recognized God’s hand in his seeming miraculous preservation from sudden and violent death – to carry on a ministry of sharing the Gospel – the good news that Jesus had died for him and for all who would trust Him.&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Greg Locke’s grandmother loves the Lord and prays for Greg. He needs prayer because he gets addicted to rap music at age thirteen. By then he’s already stealing and has been before a judge three times. Wanting to be a rap star, he does well and has a chance to make a TV commercial. But the court orders his mother to put him in a home to learn discipline. She chooses a Christian home, and while there Greg goes to a revival where he is saved. Now an evangelist.&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>
