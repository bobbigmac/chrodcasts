		<description>Genuine hope is difficult to find, and the hope that is offered to us in this world is often empty. All the people and material things we have placed our confidence in have let us down. However, the love of God reaches every single person on earth through Christ. It is a love that cannot be lost, and will never fail. It is a love that is able to rescue us from despair. It is the only true Hope.

	<description><![CDATA[<p>The American church is crumbling. Our influence in society is fading. Our light is growing dim. We are full of holes, breaking down, and desperately in need of repair. If we were to take a survey today about what the American church needs most, we would receive a myriad of answers – more outreach, better preaching, collaboration and unity, correct doctrine, more creative programs. Well, Paul today sums it all up in one word: love. Love builds the church of God. </p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>In our passage today, Paul says that we are like little seeds. We’re pretty small. We don’t look all that impressive. This little seed doesn’t appear glorious at all. That is, unless you bury it in the ground. Bury this tiny seed in the dirt and what is it that soon bursts forth? A plant thousands of times the size of that seed, full of flowers with breathtaking color, beauty, and glory.</p> 
<p>And that is a tiny picture of what soon will happen when our bodies are buried in the ground if we are in Christ. Just as you can’t see the full glory of what is contained in this seed until it is buried in the ground, you can’t see our full glory now. But once we are buried, the glory of who we really are through Jesus will be revealed. A glory thousands of times greater than what you can see right now; full of breathtaking beauty, power, and light.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Are you acutely aware of the spiritual world? I want to say to you this morning that the reason Jesus was able to perform so many miracles, the reason so many people flocked to Him, the reason He was able to change our world forever is that He lived, thought, worked, and taught in the power of the same Spirit of God that is available to us.</p>
<p>It was not because He was also fully God. When Jesus came to Earth He veiled His divine glory, He emptied Himself in order to not just be our Savior but our example as well. While living on Earth, Jesus used His divine powers infrequently, if at all. The reason His life had such far-reaching power is that Jesus lived in complete dependence upon the same Spirit of God available to us.</p>

The reason His life had such far-reaching power is that Jesus lived in complete dependence upon the same Spirit of God available to us.

If you have eyes to see the wonderful, exciting kingdom of God that is all around you, you will find that you are someone full of agape love. 
My prayer for you is that you would have a rich life of joy and power, abundant in supernatural results, with a constant clear vision of never-ending life in God’s world before you, and of the everlasting significance of your work day by day.

	<description><![CDATA[Paul gives a warning to the church. It’s a warning we really shouldn’t need, but we <em>do</em>. We should have learned this lesson by looking at people throughout the history of our faith, but we haven’t. The warning is this: Being a child of God is not about rituals … it is not about experiences … it’s not about infrequent, scattered times of devotion to God. Being a child of God is about a long obedience in the same direction. A <em>long obedience </em>in the <em>same </em>direction.  We don’t go one direction Sunday morning and a different direction Friday night. It’s not about occasional acts of obedience scattered throughout the year. Can it be said that <em>my </em>life is a <em>long obedience </em>in the direction of Christ?

Discover the blessedness, the joy that comes from going low.”

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Once we come to the realization of who we are, the beloved sons and daughter of God, we need to find a way for that to take root in our hearts and minds. If this would happen, we would stop  worrying about our day and start it in giddy anticipation of the wonderful gifts our Father is going to bring into our lives. Imagine walking through 2020 listening to the voice of our Heavenly Father saying to us, “I have a gift for you today, and I can’t wait for you to see it!”  That is the life Jesus wants us to have. That is life itself. That is life as the precious one of God that each one of us truly is.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>In C.S. Lewis’ “The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe”, two of the main characters, Susan and Lucy, hear about Aslan, the Christ-figure in the story. They as if he is a man. And they are told: “Aslan a man? Certainly not…. he is the King of the woods … Aslan is a lion – the Lion, the great Lion.” “Ooh!” said Susan. “Is he quite safe? I shall feel rather nervous meeting a lion.” “That you will … and make no mistake, if there’s anyone who can appear before Aslan without their knees knocking, they’re either braver than most or else just silly.” “Then he isn’t safe?” asked Lucy. “Safe? Who said anything about being safe? ‘Course he isn’t safe. But he’s good.”</p> 
<p>Most people don’t want such a dangerous God. They prefer a god who is safe. A god they can manage. And we have to decide: Do I want the real thing?<br> 
Because if even some of us actually want the real thing, the tangible presence of God that is not safe will be manifest among us today.</p>

He receives this news that makes his heart pound, lips quiver, and legs tremble. But then he makes a decision.

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Many Christians find themselves  asking: “Where are the rivers of living water? Why am I not experiencing the abundant life Jesus talks about? Why do I struggle so much to grow?” If you find yourself there today don’t run from it. Don’t try to cover it up. Don’t try to act like you’re doing better than you actually are. That’s what Satan wants us to do. Let’s be real and honest about how we’re doing.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>For years, popular musicians have attempted to answer the question: “What is love?” There are over 10,000 songs on file at the U.S Copyright Office that begin with the words, “Love is …” Examples include: From 1912, “Love is a Sickness Full of Woes”; from 1927, “Love is Like the Influenza”; from 1968, “Love is Psychedelic”; from 1988, “Love is for Suckers”; and from 2007, “Love is a Losing Game”. </p>
<p>As we read this description of agape love in our passage today, we might feel as if we are playing a losing game – that this is impossible, I will never be like this. Well, I want to start this morning by letting you know that you were created to love like this. Jesus loved you into existence so that you could be as wonderful as Him – full of His love. And if Jesus has His way, it will happen.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>There are incredible parallels between the first century church in Corinth to which Paul wrote this letter we will be studying and the church in America. First century Corinth was a very wealthy and prosperous place. America is wealthy and prosperous. But the church in Corinth was in trouble and so is the church in America. Somewhere around 8,000 churches die in the United States every year. That means 150 will die this week. Less than 20% of Americans attend church on a regular basis. Studies show that like the Corinthians, when it comes to morality, we are indistinguishable from the world. And we are paying the price.

This one act would completely revolutionize our lives. If we handed the world over to God we would discover the easy yoke of Jesus. And we would finally be able to lie down and sleep at night. We would be set free from our stress. We would see and experience all of the wonderful gifts God has given us today.

	<description><![CDATA[<p>20th century French playwright, Samuel Beckett, wrote a play in which the curtain opens to show a stage littered with junk. And for 30 long seconds, the audience sits and stares at that junk. And then the curtain closes. That’s it. Beckett was saying that our lives are like that. We are surrounded by junk; garbage. And that’s all we can hope for. And that’s what the world is like if there is no God. We are surrounded by ugliness. Life is a constant struggle. It is sad, hopeless, and empty.</p>
<p>But in our passage today, Paul is going to take a good look at the church and say: “That’s how some of you are living.” Paul’s going to say: “There are people in the church who live as if they are surrounded by ugliness; they live without hope in their hearts; they live as if they are alone.” They profess a relationship with Jesus but they live like atheists, they don’t really love Jesus. And because of this, they’re cursed. They’re separated from the complete sufficiency, the overwhelming goodness, the abundance of love and joy that is available in God.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Do you know that the kingdom of heaven is here, now? Every serious Bible scholar will tell you that the primary theme of Jesus’ teaching was the kingdom of heaven.

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Our world talks a lot about peace. It’s a popular slogan in songs and on TV. If it’s not about Jesus, it’s all a sham.  John Lennon famously sang, “Give peace a chance.” Well, John abandoned his son, Julian, when he was five years old. Listen to what Julian said about his dad: “He was a hypocrite. Dad could talk about peace and love to the world, but he could never show it to the people who supposedly meant the most to him: his wife and son. How can you talk about peace and love and have a family in bits and pieces-no communication, adultery, divorce? You can't.”  Peace comes only in the presence of God. And that peaceful presence is available to us in our homes – whether we are living alone or married with kids.</p>

Real silence today is hard to find.  Recent research has found that spending time in silence causes new cells to grow in our brain. Silence lowers blood pressure, boosts the body’s immune system, promotes good hormone regulation, prevents plaque formation in arteries, and lowers stress. 
And to go even deeper, it is in the silence that we discover our soul … and it is in the silence that we find God. Habakkuk 2:20, “The Lord is in his holy temple; let all the earth be silent before him."

	<description><![CDATA[<p>God made men and women very different. We have been given different roles. And the process of bringing us together, in marriage and in the church, can cause sparks. This was causing sparks in the Corinthian church, causing division and confusion. And that is Satan’s main goal today: to drive the people of God apart.</p> 
<p>Right now, Satan  is working in our relationships, our marriages, our church to drive us apart; to keep us from being one. He knows that if the people of God come together in their marriages and in their churches … it’s over. He has nothing that can stand against a united church. If we actually learn to live as one, as God is one, in our churches and in our homes, no force in hell or on earth could stand against us.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Very few Christians today talk about their relationship with Jesus with people in the world. It’s almost as if we’re embarrassed about it. We don’t think it’s appropriate. So, we keep quiet. In fact, a recent Barna study found that almost <em>half </em>of millennial Christians (in their twenties and thirties) say that sharing your faith with others is (are you ready for this?) <em>wrong</em>. They don’t say it’s <em>hard</em>, <em>awkward</em>, or <em>uncomfortable</em>; they say it’s <em>wrong</em>!</p>
<p>What would it take for you to join Christians throughout the world and Christians throughout history who refused to be quiet about their faith in Jesus? We have the same power they have – the same Spirit of God is living inside us. The decline of Christianity in America can be reversed … if the people of God choose to live as His witnesses today.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>A physiologist and former British Olympian has unveiled a blueprint for what he describes as the world's ultimate superhuman. It includes the acceleration of Usain Bold’s legs (whose fast-twitch muscle fibers can accelerate faster than 99.9% of people), the lungs of British rower Steve Redgrave (whose seven-liter capacity means he can take in a third more oxygen than the average person), the brain of “human calculator” Scott Flansburg (who can add numbers faster than a real calculator), the vision of Veronica Seider (able to distinguish detail from up to a mile away, her sight is 20 times better than the average human), the ears of Daniel Kish (able to navigate his environment by measuring the echo response of clicks made by his tongue), and the voice of Georgia Brown (whose vocal range spans 8 octaves).</p> 
<p>Well, God is assembling a body greater than that right here – the superhuman body of Christ! A body that has been gifted with such things (as we talked about last week) as: miraculous powers, prophecy, mountain-moving faith, healing power, life-giving mercy, and wisdom from another world. And if you are a follower of Jesus, you are part of that superhuman body.</p>

They would burn up things that were valuable – incense, first fruits, animals that were their livelihood – and Scripture said it was a pleasing aroma to God. It smelled good!

Perhaps He is saying to us that the comfort we have found in going out, watching sports, and being around people (human-based comfort) has been taken away because God wants to supply all our comfort Himself. He wants to be our everything. He wants us to know that He is enough.
