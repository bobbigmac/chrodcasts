        <![CDATA[<p>What if the secret origin story of humanism is just... ancient people getting tired of handing over their goats? In this episode, Greg Epstein — Harvard and MIT's Humanist Chaplain and author of the NY Times bestseller <em>Good Without God</em> — joins us to break down what humanism actually is, where it came from, and why humans have been quietly side-eyeing authority since long before anyone had a podcast to complain about it. Greg brings the kind of clarity that makes you realize some of our biggest existential questions have been getting wrestled with for millennia, by regular people who just wanted to live a good life without being strong-armed into it. It's part philosophy crash course, part history lesson, and entirely the conversation you didn't know you needed.</p><p><strong>ABOUT GREG EPSTEIN<br></strong>Greg M. Epstein serves as Humanist Chaplain at Harvard &amp; MIT, where he advises students, faculty, and staff members on ethical and existential concerns from a humanist perspective. TechCrunch's first “ethicist in residence,” he has been called “a symbol of the transition in how Americans relate to organized religion” (The Conversation).

        <![CDATA[<p>In this debut episode of <em>How to Humanist</em>, Shay Leonia introduces herself as the mildly terrified new podcast host representing a nearly century-old institution, the American Humanist Association, admits she had no clue who Thomas Paine was, and unpacks how growing up with a radically hospitable mother shaped her understanding of empathy long before she had language for it. It’s a funny, tender reflection on impostor syndrome, inherited kindness, and the dangerous possibility that offering someone cake might be more revolutionary than we think.<strong><br></strong> <br><strong>American Empathy Project: </strong><a href="https://americanempathyproject.org">https://americanempathyproject.org</a><br><strong>For more on humanism:</strong> <a href="https://linktr.ee/americanhumanist">https://linktr.ee/americanhumanist</a></p>]]>
