      <title>When You Stop Holding Back | Pre-Decide: Part 5</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you ever feel like you'd be happier if you could make a little more money, buy that car, or land that job? The Bible tells us it's more blessed to give than to receive. (Acts 20:35) But how is that possible? And how do you stop holding yourself back from being generous? We'll find out in this message. </p><p>ABOUT THIS MESSAGE</p><p>What if becoming the person you want to be starts long before the moment you make a decision? Before you click "buy," before you take one more bite, or before you lash out at the people you love. Can the decisions you make today help you live the life you really want tomorrow? Let's learn together in our new message series, <i>Pre-Decide</i>. </p><p>We’ve hand-picked articles, podcasts, and Bible Plans to help you learn how to make better choices in your life. Check out our <a href="https://go2.lc/betterchoices-ytc"><i>Pre-Decide</i> resources page</a> to learn more! </p><p>WE’RE OPEN</p><p>We’re continuing to monitor guidelines and best practices for gathering in a safe way.

      <itunes:summary>One church. Thousands of locations. Let&apos;s gather together in our homes to celebrate life in Christ this Easter. 

As humans, we like to feel like we’re in control. We like to know what we can expect. But right now, we’re uncertain. We’re distant. Right now, life feels out of control. But maybe we never had it in the first place. In this special Easter message, Pastor Craig Groeschel will show you how we gain strength, peace, and courage when we surrender control of our lives to God. It won’t always be easy—but it will always be worth it.</itunes:summary>
