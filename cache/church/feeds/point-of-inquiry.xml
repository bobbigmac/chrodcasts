Ryan speaks about how the field of social science is changing with the improvements made to surveying, the underlying causes moving people to become less religiously affiliated, unpacking why America has been so historically religious compared to other countries, how religious economy theory fits into this the rise of the nones, and the role the internet has played in shifting people away from religion.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Ryan Burge is an Assistant Professor of Political Science and Graduate Coordinator at Eastern Illinois University and a pastor in Mt.

What are the underlying factors causing this shift?</p> <p> </p> <p>In today's episode we dive into what the data shows about this movement with Ryan Burge, author of the new book <em><a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Nones-Where-They-Came-Going/dp/1506465854">The Nones: Where They Came From, Who They Are, And Where They Are Going</a></em> (Fortress Press, 2021). Ryan speaks about how the field of social science is changing with the improvements made to surveying, the underlying causes moving people to become less religiously affiliated, unpacking why America has been so historically religious compared to other countries, how religious economy theory fits into this the rise of the nones, and the role the internet has played in shifting people away from religion.</p> <p> </p> <p>Ryan Burge is an Assistant Professor of Political Science and Graduate Coordinator at Eastern Illinois University and a pastor in Mt. Vernon, Illinois.</p> <p></p>]]></content:encoded>

His work has involved working with a team that discovered the top quark, a fundamental particle of nature.</p> <p>You can see more of his great physicsfun experiments on <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/physicsfun/">Instagram</a> and <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVs-1uGf7DWid0GNWgPWLzw">Youtube</a>.</p> This Week's Music <p style="text-align: center;"><a href= "https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Blue_Dot_Sessions/Duck_Lake/Idle_Ways" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Idle Ways" by Blue Dot Sessions</a> / <a href= "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC BY-NC 4.0</a> <a href= "https://www.freemusicarchive.org/music/Pictures_of_the_Floating_World/Nebraska_Fireworks/Cold_1315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Cold" by Pictures of the Floating World</a> / <a href= "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">CC BY-NC-SA 3.0</a> <a href= "https://freemusicarchive.org/music/springtide/This_is_the_End" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Teahouse and Bamboo Trees" by springtide</a> / <a href= "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of <em>Point of Inquiry</em>, cohost Leighann Lord talks with fellow comic Ian Harris.</p> <p>Besides being a comedian, Harris is a voice actor, writer, director, and MMA trainer. He is also an outspoken atheist and skeptic who confronts magical thinking and religion in his comedy. In 2019, Leighann Lord and Harris joined forces and performed their mainstage show at Dragon Con. That show, dubbed "The Science and Fiction Comedy Show," blended nerdom (it's Drgaon Con after all!), atheism, skepticism, and science.</p> <p>In this engaging interview with Lord, Harris tells us about what it's like to perform skeptical comedy for audiences and lets us in on the type of audience that gives the best laughs.  Harris explains how he effectively uses his comedy to teach people skeptical and critical thinking.  He's seen certain topics, such as climate change, become politicized and divorced from science. It's his hope to rectify that with his comedy. Lord and Harris also dive into the observation that even within the atheist community, many hold onto their own "religious" beliefs and not everyone in the community is a critical thinker or skeptic. They then discuss the resulting schism or gap that's been created.</p> <p>You can follow Leighann on twitter <a href= "https://twitter.com/LeighannLord"><span class= "css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">@LeighannLord</span></a>.<br />  You can follow Ian on twitter <a href= "https://twitter.com/comediocre"><span class= "css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">@comediocre</span></a> and check out his YouTube channel, <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/user/ApocalypseComedyShow/featured">IanHarrisComedian,</a> where you can enjoy videos from his stand-up specials, "Critical & Thinking" and "ExtraOrdinary", his Reason Rally performances, interviews, and more.</p>]]></description>

How does the centuries-old mythology of race impact the practice of medicine well into the 21st century?</p> <p dir="ltr"></p> <p dir="ltr">On this episode of Point of Inquiry, Kavin Senapathy speaks with author Angela Saini about her book <a href= "https://www.angelasaini.co.uk/superior" target="_blank" rel= "noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.angelasaini.co.uk/superior&source=gmail&ust=1568900837501000&usg=AFQjCNEznp_zszmh5D-Ybyud02KsRr4C7Q"> Superior: The Return of Race Science</a>. The Telegraph advises "philosophically and historically uneducated scientists" along with those with "more murky motivations" to read this "brilliant and devastating" book.</p> <p dir="ltr">While you're here, we'd like to give a shout-out to the Guerrilla Skeptics on Wikipedia. While Kavin was researching the episode, she realized that Superior didn't have a page on Wikipedia. She alerted GSoW's Rob Palmer and their team had a page up within 48 hours!</p> <p>The Scientific American blog post mentioned in the episode, "The Internet Is a Cesspool of Racist Pseudoscience," can be found <a href= "https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/the-internet-is-a-cesspool-of-racist-pseudoscience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/the-internet-is-a-cesspool-of-racist-pseudoscience/&source=gmail&ust=1568900837501000&usg=AFQjCNHDO8u70Yv8kMU2vZ4CMkCTP8x3LA"> here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The evidence is clear that humans are innately poor at assessing risk in our personal lives, in part due to how our brains are wired, and that can make it challenging to make informed decisions about everything from vaccines and medicines to diet and children's safety.

The interview takes listeners through key concepts in risk and risk perception, including the difference between hazard and risk, and whether zero risk is ever really possible. How can putting risk into perspective inform regulatory actions? How does environmental justice tie into health and risk perception? How are marketers taking advantage of our inability to accurately assess risk?

But in just the past handful of years, we've learned that planets orbiting stars are the rule, not the exception, which suggests that there may be 200 billion planets just in our galaxy alone, and trillions upon trillions of planets throughout the known universe. Surely, many of the planets in the Milky Way must be home to life forms, and even technologically advanced civilizations.</p> <p>So where the heck are they? Why can't we find them? Why won't they talk to us? Would we even know it if they did? To talk about the prospects for life on other worlds, intelligent and otherwise, Point of Inquiry host Paul Fidalgo talks to journalist Lee Billings. Lee is a reporter and editor for <em>Scientific American</em> covering space and physics, as well as the author of <em>Five Billion Years of Solitude: The Search for Life Among the Stars</em>.</p> <p>Billings explains how this quest, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, has become increasingly daunting even as our knowledge of the cosmos grows richer. It is a quest rife with pitfalls, paradoxes, and plain old speculation, and so far, it has proven fruitless. But despite our apparent solitude, we keep looking. We keep listening. And we keep reaching out. Do we have the patience and the will to continue searching and waiting for a sign that may never come?</p>]]></description>

Lee is a reporter and editor for <em>Scientific American</em> covering space and physics, as well as the author of <em>Five Billion Years of Solitude: The Search for Life Among the Stars</em>.</p> <p>Billings explains how this quest, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, has become increasingly daunting even as our knowledge of the cosmos grows richer. It is a quest rife with pitfalls, paradoxes, and plain old speculation, and so far, it has proven fruitless. But despite our apparent solitude, we keep looking. We keep listening. And we keep reaching out. Do we have the patience and the will to continue searching and waiting for a sign that may never come?</p>]]></content:encoded>

President Trump has exacerbated the ensuing tension and fear by refusing to assign full responsibility to the white supremacists, and insisting that the blame be shared by some contingent of an alleged "alt-left."</p> <p>It is time for humanism to respond once again. Our guest for this episode of <em>Point of Inquiry</em> is James Croft of the St. Louis Ethical Society, who encourages us to fully live out the values of humanism, not just as an academic philosophy but as an urgent call to act on behalf of others. "Be not restrained," he advises, as he and host Paul Fidalgo discuss how humanists can lead the way in healing our national wounds, but that the process must begin by honestly acknowledging and addressing the injustices that have permeated American society from its very beginnings.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr"> <div><p></div> <div>How did a man living an ostensibly godless, hedonistic life become the champion of the very groups who one would expect to denounce his behavior? Being a real estate mogul and reality TV star, it's no secret to anyone that President Trump has spent far more time in country clubs than churches. A man who's had several wives, owned casinos and bars, and had multiple accusations of sexual assault leveled against him is hardly the pinnacle of virtue the religious right professes to yearn for. Trump's aggressively nationalistic campaign rhetoric clearly appealed to the so-called "alt-right," but he could not have won the election without simultaneously appealing to religious conservatives.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> How did a man living an ostensibly godless, hedonistic life become the champion of the very groups who one would expect to denounce his behavior? Being a real estate mogul and reality TV star, it's no secret to anyone that President Trump has spent far more time in country clubs than churches. A man who's had several wives, owned casinos and bars, and had multiple accusations of sexual assault leveled against him is hardly the pinnacle of virtue the religious right professes to yearn for. Trump's aggressively nationalistic campaign rhetoric clearly appealed to the so-called "alt-right," but he could not have won the election without simultaneously appealing to religious conservatives. So what happened? </p> <p> Today's guest is investigative journalist Sarah Posner, whose expertise in reporting on religion and the conservative movement enable her to unravel the reasoning behind Trump's success with evangelical Christians.

At the same time, some institutions of higher learning have speech codes which many feel are serving to silence debate and discussion among students in the name of protecting feelings. </p> <p> Our guest this week, Wendy Kaminer, is among those who believe that things like speech codes and trigger warnings have gotten out of control. Kaminer is a lawyer and writer who has dedicated much of her life's work to defending free speech. She and host Lindsay Beyerstein engage in a spirited discussion about the grayest areas concerning speech and censorship on campus and in the culture at large. </p> <p> Kaminer will also be one of the many fantastic speakers at the fourth <a href="http://womeninsecularism.org">Women in Secularism conference</a>, September 23-25 in Alexandria, Virgina. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><p></p>
<p>For a very long time marriage was considered a foundation of
American life. Adulthood and marriage came hand in hand, and
shortly after marriage children were the next logical step.
Breaking that mold wasn't a socially acceptable or financially
viable option for women. Today, however, marriage rates show us a
very different picture of what is considered the norm. To lend some
insight into these changing conventions, <em>Point of
Inquiry</em> welcomes Rebecca Traister, an author and
award-winning journalist who is the writer-at-large for
<i><em>New York Magazine</i></em> and a
contributing editor at <i><em>Elle</i></em>. Her new
book is <i><em>All the Single Ladies: Unmarried Women and the
Rise of an Independent Nation</i></em>.</p>
<p></p></p>
<p><p> </p>
<p>In 1960, the majority of American women were married by age 29.
Today only 20 percent of American women are married by then. For
over a century the median age of first marriages for women in
America had remained between 20 and 22, but in recent years it has
jumped dramatically to age 27.  Overall, fewer American women
are married than ever before and Traister has investigated what's
behind this dramatic change, and what it means for a new generation
of single women in America.</p>

<p>Medical doctors can hold our lives in their hands. But with great power comes great responsibility, and doctors owe it to their patients to provide accurate information and treatments based on science and evidence. This is the standard we expect and take for granted; yet one doctor, Stanislaw Burzynski, has been skirting medical ethics and scientific protocols for decades with his controversial and unproven cancer treatments, which he claims without evidence, can destroy cancer cells. The Center for Inquiry, which produces this podcast, has worked to expose Burzynski’s treatments and for the FDA to <a href="<a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/newsroom/stop_burzynskis_dangerous_cancer_treatments/">http://www.centerforinquiry.net/newsroom/stop_burzynskis_dangerous_cancer_treatments/</a>"><a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/newsroom/stop_burzynskis_dangerous_cancer_treatments/">reinstate restrictions</a></a> on his dubious medical trials.</p>
<p></p></p>
<p><p></p>
<p>This week, <em>Point of Inquiry</em> welcomes science journalist Tamar Wilner to discuss the most recent progress in the Burzynski case, and what it’s like to pursue the hard truth within such a murky and emotionally fraught situation. Wilner is a frequent contributor to the <em>Columbia Journalism Review</em> and a consultant for the Fact Checking Project at the American Press Institute; she’s written numerous articles on controversial science issues including her recent <a href="<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2016/03/04/stanislaw-burzynski-cancer-medical-malfeasance-429057.html">http://www.newsweek.com/2016/03/04/stanislaw-burzynski-cancer-medical-malfeasance-429057.html</a>"><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2016/03/04/stanislaw-burzynski-cancer-medical-malfeasance-429057.html"><em>Newsweek</em> feature</a></a>, “Cancer ‘Visionary’ Stanislaw Burzynski Stands Trial for Unprecedented Medical Malfeasance.” She’s also been featured at <em>Skeptical Inquirer</em> with a piece entitled <a herf="<a href="http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/five_things_i_learned_writing_about_stanislaw_burzynski">http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/five_things_i_learned_writing_about_stanislaw_burzynski</a>"><a href="http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/five_things_i_learned_writing_about_stanislaw_burzynski">“Five Things I Learned Writing about Stanislaw Burzynski.”</a></a></p>
<p></p></p>
<p><p> </p>
<p>A further explanation of Burzynski’s treatments, the lack of science behind them, and his run-ins with medical authorities can be found in a feature by Dr. David Gorski in the <a herf="<a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/stanislaw_burzynski_four_decades_of_an_unproven_cancer_cure">http://www.csicop.org/si/show/stanislaw_burzynski_four_decades_of_an_unproven_cancer_cure</a>"><a href="http://bit.ly/GorskiBurzynski">March-April 2014 issue of <em>Skeptical Inquirer</em></a></a></p>

<p>This week we welcome back journalist Johann Hari, author of <i><em>Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs</i></em>. Hari is a vocal advocate for ending the drug war, and he joins us this week in advance of the UN General Assembly’s special session on drugs, being held April 18 to 21. This special session was not supposed to be held until 2019, but in September of 2012, Mexico, Colombia, and Guatemala expressed the need to hold an international conference on drug policy reform sooner than scheduled. The provision was sponsored by Mexico and co-sponsored by 95 other countries that are struggling with the violence and chaos surrounding current global drug policy. </p>
<p> </p></p>
<p><p></p>
<p>Hari believes that this meeting represents a major shift in the conversation surrounding the drug war. As more and more countries are putting pressure on the United States to enact effective and humane drug policy options, Hari anticipates that these UN drug summits will become less about policy review and more about having a sane global discussion about the way we regulate and criminalize drugs.</p>

<div>Many of us picture our dying moments as being surrounded by loved ones, uttering last words of gratitude and advice before we slip off into a peaceful departure. Yet the reality is that dying is often a long, painful, and constantly fluctuating process. Our guest this week, Ann Neumann, writes a monthly column at <i><em>The Revealer</i></em> where she examines the intersection between religion and medicine, and she is the author of the new book, <i><em>The Good Death: An Exploration of Dying in America</i></em>.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Neumann was inspired to write the book after the struggle of caring for her father while he was dying. The experience she had was nothing like anything she had ever seen before in American culture. To better understand what she had gone through, she began volunteering at hospices and studying various perspectives on life and death. She explored everything from academic lectures to pro-life groups, giving her a wide understanding of the differences between the cultural interpretation and medical reality of death.</div>

<div><p></div>
<div>John Allen Paulos is an award winning mathematician and best selling author. A professor in mathematics at Temple University, he has written for <i><em>The Guardian</i></em>, CFI’s Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, and his monthly column for ABCNews.com, “Who’s Counting?” His new book is called <i><em>A Numerate Life: A Mathematician Explores the Vagaries of Life, His Own and Probably Yours</i></em>.</div>
<div></p></div>
<div><p></div>
<div>Paulos uses basic mathematic principles to lend a fresh perspective to everyday life, and the results can be fascinating. He sheds light on everything from the mathematical science behind romantic crushes to the astronomical consequences of the butterfly effect. Some of the harsher mathematical realities can be troubling, like the inevitable probability of becoming more jaded as we age. But Paulos’s mathematical message also has plenty to take solace in, like knowing that dimensional geography suggests that every single one of us is far more peculiar than we may be willing to admit. That’s right, you are not the only weirdo you know; in reality we’re all a bunch of weirdos.  </div>

<p>Today’s guest is former white supremacist Arno Michaelis, author of <i><em>My Life After Hate</i></em>. A leader within what he called a “racial holy war," Michaelis later realized his hate was misplaced, the product of fear, anger, and an overall misunderstanding of concepts such as forgiveness and personal responsibility. Today he is a Buddhist and anti-violence activist with Serve 2 Unite, an organization that works with student leaders to create compassionate, nonviolent leadership in their communities.</p>
<p> </p></p>
<p><p></p>
<p>In a frank discussion with Josh Zepps, Michaelis reflects on his mistakes, and how he came to let go of his hate and anger. He notes the similarities he perceives between the language and emotion of the white power movement he left, and that of the campaign rhetoric of Donald Trump, whose rallies are now plagued by racially charged clashes and violence. Michaelis joins us today to offer some insight on this worldview of rage, and how we can work toward alternatives to hate and violence.</p>

<div>Konnikova analyses the tactics that con artists use to appeal to our sensibilities, gain our trust, and lower our defenses, and she explores what motivates these fraudsters to do what they do.

Konnikova posits that a combination of entitlement and power spurs con artists to jump through hoops most of us could never imagine. </div>

She experienced first hand the often laughable degrees of arbitrary censorship and cultural oppression, and simultaneously the liberty with which certain members of society could behave as they pleased. She discovered a world that both reinforced and contradicted commonly held beliefs about the restrictiveness of the culture of Islam in the Gulf States, and wrote about her experiences in a <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/2/18/10887776/middle-east-censorship">recent article at <em>Vox</em></a>.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><p></p>
<p>Most of us have no problem operating under the notion that we should do unto others as we would have others do unto us. But what do we make of people who do go well beyond that, while asking for nothing in return? Why are often perplexed by those who are willing to put their health and well being on the line for complete strangers? Today’s guest is Larissa MacFarquhar, staff writer at <em>The New Yorker</em> and author of the new book <i><em>Strangers Drowning: Grappling with Impossible Idealism, Drastic Choices, and the Overpowering Urge to Help</i>.</em> </p>
<p> </p></p>
<p><p></p>
<p>MacFarquhar argues that we have a history of labeling people who help excessively as having some sort of physiological disconnect, a mental health condition that causes them to give more than what seems reasonable to the rest of society. She finds this resistance to do-gooders troubling, and that our defensive need to justify their behavior may say more about our own philosophical shortcomings than it does about the altruists among us.</p>

Today’s guest is Larissa MacFarquhar, staff writer at <em>The New Yorker</em> and author of the new book <i><em>Strangers Drowning: Grappling with Impossible Idealism, Drastic Choices, and the Overpowering Urge to Help</i>.</em> </p> <p> </p></p> <p><p></p> <p>MacFarquhar argues that we have a history of labeling people who help excessively as having some sort of physiological disconnect, a mental health condition that causes them to give more than what seems reasonable to the rest of society. She finds this resistance to do-gooders troubling, and that our defensive need to justify their behavior may say more about our own philosophical shortcomings than it does about the altruists among us.</p> <p></p></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div>The freethought movement has seen two of its most respected and influential institutions combine into what has been called a “supergroup” for secularism. The Center for Inquiry, the organization that proudly produces this program, announced in January that it would merge with the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason & Science, and that Robyn Blumner, the Richard Dawkins Foundation’s president and CEO, would take over from Ronald A. Lindsay as CEO of CFI. </div>
<div></p></div>
<div><p></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Both Robyn Blumner and Ron Lindsay appear together as our guests this week, here to discuss with host Josh Zepps the reasoning behind the merger, and how the complementary strengths of the newly-joined organizations can make a larger impact on behalf of their shared mission: fostering a secular society based on reason, science, free inquiry, and humanist values. </div>
<div></p></div>
<div><p></div>
<div> </div>
<div>We learn more about Blumner’s background as both an executive and a journalist, as well as what the Richard Dawkins Foundation (now a division of CFI) brings to the table. We also get a look back at Lindsay’s tenure at CFI, and how he has helped to build the Center for Inquiry into a lasting institution. </div>

<div>In ancient Greece, did everyone unquestioningly believe in the gods of Olympus? Was there no one in classical Athens to write the equivalent of “The Zeus Delusion”? According to our guest this week, the Greeks’ religious beliefs were as varied and nuanced as they are today. Tim Whitmarsh is a classicist and professor of Greek Culture at University of Cambridge. In his newest book, <i><em>Battling the Gods: Atheism in the Ancient World</i></em>, he explores the skeptical aspects of ancient history that are often left out of common retellings.</div>

<div><p></div>
<div>Like so many other cultures, ancient Greece went through its own periods of enlightenment and reform, times when religion and irreligion, and superstition and rationalism, coexisted. Whitmarsh argues that we moderns shouldn’t be so quick to tie the ancient Greeks to their mythology, because along with the myths and gods there is a rich history of secularism, critical thinking and even atheism.</div>

<p>The “nones” are on the rise in the U.S. with 33 million Americans identifying as having no religious affiliation. Atheists shouldn’t get too excited, though, because 68% of the unaffiliated indicate that they do believe in some sort of god. What kind of god do the nones believe in? This week’s guest, Rabbi Mark Wildes, wants it to be the God of Abraham.</p>
<p></p></p>
<p><p> </p>
<p>Rabbi Mark Wildes is the founder and director of the Manhattan Jewish Experience, a program for young Jewish professionals in their 20s and 30s with little or no background in Judaism interested in connecting with the community. With the unaffiliated being concentrated heavily in the young adult demographic, and with 1 in 5 American Jews identifying as nones, Rabbi Wildes believes there very well may be something about Judaism that could draw in millennials, those who are looking for a certain kind of moral guidance that includes both purpose and reason. </p>

<p>During the perennial War on Christmas, certain Christians often feel the need to remind the rest pf us what the holiday season is really about. It’s Jesus Christ’s birthday and we’re all invited to the party… if by “party” you mean sitting reverently in pews at Christmas mass. Something as little as changing the seasonal decorations on a cardboard coffee cup is enough to put some Christians on edge, as some felt the new red and green Starbucks cups insufficiently acknowledged the role of Christ. Andrea Williams of the U.K.’s Christian Concern wrote, “This is a denial of historical reality and the great Christian heritage behind the American Dream that has so benefitted Starbucks.” But perhaps it's folks like Williams who are the ones guilty of historical denial.</p>
<p></p></p>
<p><p> </p>
<p>Here to talk about the real historical origins of Christmas is writer and philosophy professor David Kyle Johnson, author of the new book, <i><em>The Myths that Stole Christmas</i></em>. Johnson explains how “the reason for the season” is just the season itself. He discusses how Christmas went from being a secular holiday to a religious one, how Jesus was inserted into it, the origins of Santa Claus, and all the other myths in between that still hold sway in our modern-day seasonal celebrations. </p>

<p>After the Paris attacks, tensions are running higher than they have in many years over the threat posed by Islamism, how we should talk about it, and how policy should respond to it. One of our most difficult cultural challenges is distinguishing the acts of violent Islamists from public attitudes towards Muslims in general, and specifically how heated and often ugly rhetoric impacts how we confront the massive refugee crisis.</p>

One of our most difficult cultural challenges is distinguishing the acts of violent Islamists from public attitudes towards Muslims in general, and specifically how heated and often ugly rhetoric impacts how we confront the massive refugee crisis.</p> <p> </p></p> <p><p></p> <p>To discuss this thorny and emotionally charged issue, Josh Zepps talks with Michael Brooks, contributor for the award-winning daily political talk show, <i><em>The Majority Report</i></em>.

<p>You don’t have to be paranoid to recognize that privacy isn’t what it used to be. The government can get access to our phone calls and emails, video surveillance is becoming a norm in public places, and nearly everyone has the ability to record at will, discreetly from their cellphones. It’s no wonder that paranoia is becoming a common phenomenon. But at what point does a healthy suspicion become delusional denial?</p>
<p> </p></p>
<p><p></p>
<p>Today’s guest is clinical psychologist David Laporte, a professor of psychology at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and author of the new book, <i><em>Paranoid: Exploring Suspicion from the Dubious to the Delusional</i></em>. Laporte considers paranoia a defining affliction of the modern age, as the paranoid mindset becomes ever more legitimized by the media and political figures. Research suggests that one need not be schizophrenic to suffer from a paranoia disorder, as many people may fall within a spectrum of varying gravities of paranoia, much of which is just beginning to be understood in clinical psychology. </p>

<p>Most people know Harry Houdini as the world famous magician and illusionist, but in addition to his life as a performer, Houdini was also known to have a deep fascination with the afterlife. So much so he spent the later part of his career investigating spiritualists and mediums. With the help of his undercover assistant Rose Mackenberg, he was able to investigate spiritual claims and assess if they were in fact actual paranormal occurrences or mere illusions, much like the ones he preformed as a magician.</p>
<p></p></p>
<p><p></p>
<p>In this special Halloween extra, <i><em>Point of Inquiry</em>’s </i>producer Nora Hurley chats with Joe Nickell, the world’s leading paranormal investigator. Together, they conduct the Center for Inquiry’s Annual Houdini Séance. While summoning the dead, Nickell explains precisely how Houdini worked closely with his assistant Rose to expose fraudulent mediums and spiritualists, who were using illusions and trickery to profit off the grief of innocent people.</p>
<p></p></p>
<p><p></p>
<p>Having poor luck contacting Houdini in previous years, Joe and Nora have decided to try something different this year by opening up the séance to Rose as well. She was a vital component of Houdini’s investigations and did much of the difficult legwork in exposing spiritual frauds. Perhaps they’ll have better luck getting in touch with the afterlife by reaching out to her along with Houdini. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong><p></strong> </p>
<p>Brains, the means by which we scrutinize our world, are themselves inscrutable, and no more so than when things are going wrong. Just ask our guest this week, award winning medical journalist Jon Palfreman. After spending years of his life studying Parkinson’s in order to write the classic book, <i><em>The Case of the Frozen Addicts</i></em>, Palfreman was himself diagnosed with the very disease he built his career around understanding. Palfreman’s new book is called <i><em>Brain Storms: The Race to Unlock the Mysteries of Parkinson’s Disease</i></em>.  </p>
<p> </P></p>
<p><p></p>
<p>As modern medicine allows our bodies to live longer with each new generation, the search is on to find ways of preserving our brains from neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, diseases that drain much of the value from these lengthening lifespans. Palfreman gives insight into both our understanding of the disease, as well as the latest medical advancements and further points of study in our race to understand the brain.</p>

<p>When the public school board in Cobb County, Georgia, placed a disclaimer describing evolution as “just a theory” (in the non-scientific sense) and not a fact, citizen and author Jeffrey Selman knew he had to take a stand for the integrity of his son’s education. </p>
<p></p></p>
<p> <p></p>
<p>This week on <i><em>Point of Inquiry</i></em> Josh Zepps talks to Selman about his new book, <i><em>God Sent Me: A Textbook Case On Evolution vs. Creation</i></em>, which is Selman’s personal account of reaching out to the ACLU and taking the entire school board of Cobb County to court for misrepresenting the credibility of evolution in order to promote religious belief. A strong supporter of religious freedom and a person of faith, Selman explains why separation of church and state is especially crucial in public schools, where vulnerable younger minds are heavily influenced by peer pressure and institutional coercion. </p>

<p>One of the United States’ most prominent and respected advocates for secularism is a reverend, and that of course is our guest this week, Rev. Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. Few have more experience untangling religion from government as Rev. Lynn, who has spent a career making the case that a truly free country requires a secular government, and true religious freedom requires church-state separation.</p>
<p> </p></p>
<p><p></p>
<p>He and host Lindsay Beyerstein discuss the numerous ways the mixing of church and state have resulted in corruption and injustice. While Lynn believes that religion can play an important role in our communities and in many people’s lives, government should never be in a position to rely upon whatever charitable services a religious group might provide. Recounting some of fascinating experiences from his career, many from his new book <i><i>God and Government: Twenty-Five Years of Fighting for Equality, Secularism, and Freedom Of Conscience</i></i>, Lynn believes that the long battle for the wall of separation is one that secularists will eventually win.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">Last week marked 14 years since the attacks of 9/11, the reverberations of which will certainly be felt well into the future. But for all the impact and tragedy of the attacks, there is still so much that remains unanswered, and unanswered for. Here to lend some insight is American journalist Craig Unger, whose bestselling books include <i><em>House of Bush, House of Saud</i></em>, a book that explores the relationship between the Bush family (including its various advisors and functionaries) and the Saudi royal family. </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><p></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;">Last week marked 14 years since the attacks of 9/11, the reverberations of which will certainly be felt well into the future. But for all the impact and tragedy of the attacks, there is still so much that remains unanswered, and unanswered for. Here to lend some insight is American journalist Craig Unger, whose bestselling books include <i><em>House of Bush, House of Saud</i></em>, a book that explores the relationship between the Bush family (including its various advisors and functionaries) and the Saudi royal family. </p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"></p></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><p></p> <p> </p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;">Unger’s work drew attention to several unresolved questions about the Bush administration’s response to the attacks, and how we found ourselves mired in a global military project known as the War on Terror.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">Corporate outsourcing is so common in the U.S. that it’s become exceedingly difficult to avoid consuming products made by unregulated and unethical means. But this has not always been the norm, as several decades ago America’s working class economy was booming, and with the advent of unions, labor laws, and environmental protections, the American dream seemed alive and well.</span></p>

But this has not always been the norm, as several decades ago America’s working class economy was booming, and with the advent of unions, labor laws, and environmental protections, the American dream seemed alive and well.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"> </p></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><p></p> <p> </p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;">Here to talk about the history of corporate outsourcing in America, and the effects it has had on the economy, the environment, and the lives and well being of countless overseas workers, is author and labor expert, Dr. Erik Loomis.

<div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; widows: 1;">Ten years ago on August 29, 2005, nearly 80 percent of New Orleans found itself underwater. Over the following months, the <i><em>New York Times</i></em> sent its correspondent Gary Rivlin to live in New Orleans and report on the city’s effort to rebuild. To this day, much of New Orleans are still in shambles and few outside of the city understand the nature of the chaos that ensued during and after the storm.</div>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">Happy cows and chickens grazing in pastures, we see them plastered all over our milk and egg cartons at the grocery store. While most of us realize these images are more marketing than reality, the truth about how animals are treated in factory farming is far worse than most of us imagine. It’s not even clear exactly how much better animals fare when packaging advertises things like "cage-free," "natural" and "vegetarian-fed.” </span></p>

<div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; widows: 1;">This week on <i><em>Point of Inquiry</i></em>, our guest is Ta-Nehisi Coates, a renowned journalist and celebrated essayist on culture, history, and politics. He’s a senior editor at <i><em>The Atlantic</i></em>, where last year he ignited national introspection and heated debate with his cover feature,<a href= "<a style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations/361631/">http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations/361631/</a><span style="font-size: 12.8000001907349px;"> "> </span><a style="font-size: 12.8000001907349px; color: #1155cc;" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations/361631/" target="_blank">“The Case for Reparations.”</a><span style="font-size: 12.8000001907349px;"></a></span><span style="font-size: 12.8000001907349px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12.8000001907349px;">He is also author of the new bestseller,</span><span style="font-size: 12.8000001907349px;"> <i></span><em style="font-size: 12.8000001907349px;">Between the World and Me</i></em><span style="font-size: 12.8000001907349px;">, a book he wrote for his son about surviving in America as a black man. </span></div>

<div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; widows: 1;">Coates joins Lindsay Beyerstein to discuss the heightening racial tension in America, the result of what he describes as a country built on black bodies and black suffering. In this evocative conversation, Coates compels us to look clearly at our illusions about American identity and social mobility, and explores what difficult remedies will be necessary to begin to rectify the damage American policies have done to black men and women over the centuries. He also considers how his atheism has influenced his own thinking about civil rights, justice, and forgiveness.</div>

<div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; widows: 1;">As difficult it is to accept, there may be no loosening of the grip ISIS currently holds over its territory, at least not any time soon. Our guest, Stephen M.

Kennedy School of Government and a Fellow of the Academy of Arts and Sciences, explores with host Josh Zepps the historical precedence for successful revolutionary movements and their near-intractability once they’ve claimed power. According to Walt, once established, these revolutionary regimes will either continue to act as dangerous rogues who are isolated and contained by neighboring countries, or eventually moderate themselves to the point where even the U.S. may eventually be able to make formal connections and begin to do business.</div>

Lerner’s father Myer Lerner was a renowned infectious disease specialist who practiced medicine during what many consider to be the golden era of American medicine. Being a generation apart, Barron and Myer Lerner where taught very different approaches to medical ethics, especially when it came to patient autonomy and end-of-life issues.</span></p>

His understanding of his father’s point of view was illuminated when he was forced to make decisions about what was in the best interest of his father’s own medical care, without the benefit of his father’s input on the matter. Barron's unique perspective paints a global picture of all of the ethical considerations that come into play when practicing medicine as he wrestles with what he believes it takes to be a good doctor.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><P></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;">This week, Lindsay Beyerstein chats with medical ethicist Dr. Barron Lerner, author of the new book <i><em>The Good Doctor: A Father, A Son and the Evolution of Medical Ethics</i></em>. Lerner’s father Myer Lerner was a renowned infectious disease specialist who practiced medicine during what many consider to be the golden era of American medicine. Being a generation apart, Barron and Myer Lerner where taught very different approaches to medical ethics, especially when it came to patient autonomy and end-of-life issues.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"> </p></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><p></p> <p> </p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;">Dr. Lerner critically examines the ethical principles that his father operated under during his years in practice, and explores how these ethical norms have either retained their value or become outdated. His understanding of his father’s point of view was illuminated when he was forced to make decisions about what was in the best interest of his father’s own medical care, without the benefit of his father’s input on the matter. Barron's unique perspective paints a global picture of all of the ethical considerations that come into play when practicing medicine as he wrestles with what he believes it takes to be a good doctor.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"></p></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><p></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"> </p> <p class="MsoNormal">*Correction: In the introduction of this episode, Dr. Meyer Lerner is referenced as Barron Lerner’s father.

<div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; widows: 1;">On July 5th, 2015 Greece said no to a bailout and austerity measures that would have kept them in the eurozone, lending more uncertainty to an already weakened financial structure. The country that birthed Western democracy has found itself at a standstill, with political factions unable or unwilling to find common ground. </div>

<div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; widows: 1;">Here to discuss the psychological and historical context behind Greece's struggle is Dr. Daphne Halikiopoulou, an expert in radical nationalism and populism, and the culture and politics of Greece. She is a lecturer at Reading University in the UK on comparative politics, a regular guest on the BBC, and the author of the new book, <i><em>The Golden Dawn's 'Nationalist Solution': Explaining the Rise of the Far Right in Greece</i></em>. Recording from Athens, she and host Josh Zepps discuss the cultural and philosophical implications of Greece's financial crisis; what it represents to Greeks and what their struggle says about the security and preservation of secularist values. Dr. Halikiopoulou says that Greece wants to be a leader and an example of progress to the rest of the world, and that perhaps their biggest problem is an infatuation with saying "no" to compromise. </div>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> This week, <i><em>Point of Inquiry</i></em> welcomes Richard Dawkins for a special episode recorded before a live audience at the Center for Inquiry’s Reason for Change conference in Buffalo, New York on June 13, 2015. Dawkins is easily one of the world’s most influential and controversial scientists; a pioneer in evolutionary biology, science communication, and the public visibility of atheists. He is the author of several bestselling books including <i><em>The Selfish Gene</i></em>, <i><em>The God Delusion</i></em>, and <i><em>Unweaving the Rainbow</i></em>, and he is founder of the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science. </p> <p> Dawkins is joined by <i><em>Point of Inquiry</i></em> host Josh Zepps, discusses how he found his love for science and evolution, the importance of secular values, and how we can inspire people to appreciate and embrace science. It’s not all serious and lofty, of course, as Dawkins cops to being “pretty condescending and bossy,” and displays his remarkable proficiency with an outlandish American accent. </p> <p> <p> </p> Dawkins, who received a Lifetime Achievement Award from CFI at this conference, brings the audience to its feet with his wit and insight. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;"><p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">Celebrities have always played an oversized role in our culture, and there’s nothing new about them using their star power to endorse ideas or products. But we now live in a time in which mass media consumption is greater than ever before, and the celebrities we revere are now at our fingertips, often only tweet away. This constant bombardment of celebrity culture is proving to have a greater impact on how we live our lives than we may even realize. Even if you aim to ignore celebrity endorsement, the ripple effects in our hyper-connected world are often unavoidable.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">This week on <i>Point of inquiry</i>, Lindsay Beyerstein chats with Tim Caulfield, law professor in the School of Public Health at the University of Alberta, as well as the Canada Research Chair in Health Law and Policy. Caulfield is here to discuss his newest public health book, <i><em>Is Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong About Everything?: When Celebrity Culture and Science Clash</i></em>. Caulfield’s research provides new insight into just how much of our well-being is at the mercy of our favorite stars.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><p></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;">Celebrities have always played an oversized role in our culture, and there’s nothing new about them using their star power to endorse ideas or products. But we now live in a time in which mass media consumption is greater than ever before, and the celebrities we revere are now at our fingertips, often only tweet away. This constant bombardment of celebrity culture is proving to have a greater impact on how we live our lives than we may even realize. Even if you aim to ignore celebrity endorsement, the ripple effects in our hyper-connected world are often unavoidable.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"> </p></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><p></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;">This week on <i>Point of inquiry</i>, Lindsay Beyerstein chats with Tim Caulfield, law professor in the School of Public Health at the University of Alberta, as well as the Canada Research Chair in Health Law and Policy. Caulfield is here to discuss his newest public health book, <i><em>Is Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong About Everything?: When Celebrity Culture and Science Clash</i></em>. Caulfield’s research provides new insight into just how much of our well-being is at the mercy of our favorite stars.</p> <p> </p> <p class="MsoNormal"></p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

<div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; widows: 1;">Opponents of abortion have been largely successful in wielding the First Amendment in their fight to protest abortion providers and patients, and according to this week’s guest, this freedom has too often resulted in the terrorization and harassment of providers who are forced to live each day fearing for their lives. Few realize just how dangerous it is to be a doctor who preforms abortion procedures, who often feel that they have no choice but to wear bulletproof vests or carry a firearm for protection.</div>

They interviewed abortion providers across the country about what they deal with on a day to day basis. Talking with host Lindsay Beyerstein, Cohen brings the insight he’s gained as to how exactly we should be responding to anti-abortion terrorism, and the need to protect the lives of health care providers as much as we protect freedom of speech.</div>

Rasely spent 25 years of his life as a dedicated member of the Presbyterian Church, and even studied to become a minister. As comforting as religious belief can be, Rasley learned through his rich experiences that belief also often divides and isolates people who would otherwise find common ground, if they only embraced their shared values instead of contentious religious commandments.  </div>

<div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; widows: 1;">There are dozens of bestselling books on spirituality for teens (and many more not on the bestseller list), and many books on atheism as well. But, surprisingly, books about atheism and agnosticism specifically for young people are rare indeed. David Seidman was perplexed by this lack of material for teenagers questioning faith, and that led him to write <i><em>What If I'm an Atheist? A Teen's Guide to Exploring a Life Without Religion</i></em>.</div>

Teenagers are rebuilding their identities as adults and losing faith can be isolating and traumatic, making the need for this book long over due.</div>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">Our guest this week says that the U.S. Supreme Court’s power to interpret the Constitution is so great that they can use it to justify nearly anything they please. Even the American founders who forged the Constitution often had differing ideas of how its words should be interpreted. But one thing they did not foresee was the Supreme Court having the final say over all constitutional interpretation. Ironically, the most unconstitutional practice that we have may be the Supreme Court’s absolute power to determine what is and is not considered constitutional.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">This week <i>Point of Inquiry’s</i> Lindsay Beyerstein chats with Ian Millhiser, the author of <i>Injustices: The Supreme Court’s History of Comforting the Comfortable and Afflicting the Afflicted</i>. Millhiser takes a close look at how the various Justices of the Supreme Court have behaved throughout history, and rather than being champions of equality and justice, he concludes that the Court has largely served to perpetuate inequality and hinder progress. Millhiser argues that the only positive contributions the Supreme Court has made were a result of historical accidents, and that the most productive times of legislation in America’s history were during periods in which the Supreme Court was relatively inactive.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><p></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;">Our guest this week says that the U.S. Supreme Court’s power to interpret the Constitution is so great that they can use it to justify nearly anything they please. Even the American founders who forged the Constitution often had differing ideas of how its words should be interpreted. But one thing they did not foresee was the Supreme Court having the final say over all constitutional interpretation. Ironically, the most unconstitutional practice that we have may be the Supreme Court’s absolute power to determine what is and is not considered constitutional.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"> </p></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><p></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;">This week <i>Point of Inquiry’s</i> Lindsay Beyerstein chats with Ian Millhiser, the author of <i>Injustices: The Supreme Court’s History of Comforting the Comfortable and Afflicting the Afflicted</i>. Millhiser takes a close look at how the various Justices of the Supreme Court have behaved throughout history, and rather than being champions of equality and justice, he concludes that the Court has largely served to perpetuate inequality and hinder progress. Millhiser argues that the only positive contributions the Supreme Court has made were a result of historical accidents, and that the most productive times of legislation in America’s history were during periods in which the Supreme Court was relatively inactive.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"> </p></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><p></p> <p> </p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;">It’s a sobering and critical look at the role of the Supreme Court, this week on <i>Point of Inquiry</i>.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"></p></p>]]></content:encoded>

His videos soon exploded in popularity, and by 2011 he had moved his satirical show to television. In 2012 Jon Stewart invited Youssef to join him on <i><em>The Daily Show</i></em>, and shortly thereafter in 2013 <i><em>Time Magazine</i></em> named Bassem Youssef one of the “100 most influential people in the world.” Unfortunately, some would like to see his influence muted, and the political climate in Egypt has made it too dangerous for Youssef to continue producing his show.</div>

But could it be that our memories are so easily corrupted that we could be led to believe we’ve committed crimes that never happened?

      <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">This week on a special episode highlighting the upcoming Reason for Change conference, <em>Point of Inquiry</em> welcomes stand up comedian Leighann Lord. Talking with show producer Nora Hurley, they discuss how the worlds of comedy and skepticism are not as distant as they seem. They explore the unique dynamic comedy creates for critical thinking, and how a good joke may just be the gateway to discourse and discussion.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">Leighann will be preforming at the Reason For Change conference June 11th - 15th 2015.

According to this week’s guest, if a woman would like to give birth in America, she needs to be prepared to surrender her basic liberties.</p> Here to discuss the fight for women’s pregnancy rights is, Lynn M. Paltrow, founder of National Advocates for Pregnant Women (NAPW), a nonprofit civil rights group that advocates for pregnant and parenting women. Paltrow has also served as a senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project, as Director of Special Litigation at the Center of Reproductive Law and Policy and as Vice President for Public Affairs for Planned Parenthood of New York City. Paltrow has not only done extensive work in challenging the restrictions placed on the right to choose abortion, but also fights the prosecution and punishment of pregnant women seeking to continue their pregnancies to term.]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Fox News’ "War on Christmas" is already in full swing, as Bill O’Reilly wasted no time jumping into battle this year to defend the holiday from the great secular menace. However, it looks like Bill might be able to leave the trenches a little early this year; according to a new Pew survey, just over 70 percent of Americans believe that Jesus was literally birthed from the womb of a virgin (a staggering percentage considering that only one third of Americans report interpreting the Bible as the literal word of god). The question is why are conservative Christians so afraid of losing a fight that in so many ways they’ve already won?</div>

<div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">This week on <em>Point of Inquiry</em>, former Evangelical fundamentalist Frank Schaeffer joins us to bring first-hand insight into the irrational fear within fundamentalism, and what it says about their belief system. Schaeffer grew up in a strict Evangelical household in which he was expected to follow in the footsteps of his father, Francis August Schaeffer, a founder of what we know today as the Religious Right. Instead, he came to reject the beliefs of his father, but still maintains a place for “the divine.” He has sense spent his life talking about his journey away from the church and has written extensively about belief and religion as a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author.</div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">Alan Turing was a true visionary. Founding what we understand today as computer science, he was also a mathematician, a philosopher, and an early trailblazer for gay equality. Without his genius for codebreaking, the Second World War might have gone in a much darker direction. He saved millions of lives and potentially the world as we know it, yet his efforts for humanity were not enough to spare him the inhuman treatment he received for his sexual orientation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">Andrew Hodges was one of the first people to realize the multifaceted brilliance of Alan Turing, which eventually led him to write the renowned biography, <em>Alan Turing: The Enigma</em>, which was recently adapted into the film <em>The Imitation Game</em> starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Like Turing, Hodges is a mathematician and gay rights activist, and understands first hand the impact Turing’s life has had on our world today.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;">Alan Turing was a true visionary. Founding what we understand today as computer science, he was also a mathematician, a philosopher, and an early trailblazer for gay equality. Without his genius for codebreaking, the Second World War might have gone in a much darker direction. He saved millions of lives and potentially the world as we know it, yet his efforts for humanity were not enough to spare him the inhuman treatment he received for his sexual orientation.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"> </p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;">Andrew Hodges was one of the first people to realize the multifaceted brilliance of Alan Turing, which eventually led him to write the renowned biography, <em>Alan Turing: The Enigma</em>, which was recently adapted into the film <em>The Imitation Game</em> starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Like Turing, Hodges is a mathematician and gay rights activist, and understands first hand the impact Turing’s life has had on our world today.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;"> </p> <p> </p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white;">This week on <em>Point of Inquiry</em>, Hodges explains how Turing became so influential in so many different fields, and how his genius was so far ahead of his time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Godsil, research director of the Perception Institute, who explains how the unconscious associations and attitudes that we have towards people of different racial groups can affect the way we behave and, more importantly, what we can do to relieve some of the racial anxiety that may be inadvertently causing many of us to behave in ways that are less than enlightened.</div>]]></description>

Then as now, style manuals and grammar books placed innumerable restrictions on what is and isn’t “correct,” as "Language Mavens" continue to delight in pointing out the unforgivable errors of others. To bring some fresh perspective to this remarkably heated topic (and to let some of us who are less than perfect, grammatically speaking, off the hook), <em>Point of Inquiry</em>welcomes Harvard psychology professor Steven Pinker, author the new book <em>The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person’s Guide to Writing in the 21st Century</em>. </div>

      <description><![CDATA[<div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">There’s no doubt that Ebola is an incredibly dangerous and genuinely lethal virus, but it’s also a highly manageable one, though you’d be forgiven for thinking otherwise given the kind of hyperbolic coverage we’ve seen of the epidemic. In order to sort fact from fiction about the real threat posed by Ebola, and to better understand its origins and wider implications, <em>Point of Inquiry</em> presents a special episode, recorded before a live audience in New York.</div>
<div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </div>
<div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">We begin with a presentation by Dr. Jon Epstein, a veterinarian and epidemiologist who specializes in emerging pandemic threats in the developing world. Then <em>Point of Inquiry</em> host Josh Zepps goes more in depth, in a conversation with Dr. Epstein and Dr. Kevin Olival, a disease ecologist and evolutionary biologist. Both are world-leading experts on Ebola and disease prevention with a great deal of insight as to what governments and aid workers need to do to prevent Ebola from becoming a pandemic. </div>

But despite the fact that abortion is a normal and often necessary (one in three women will have an abortion before menopause), even those who are staunchly pro-choice feel compelled to hedge their support by making sounds about how abortions are "horrible" and "unfortunate."

      <description><![CDATA[<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;">This week Point of Inquiry welcomes journalist Mark Oppenheimer. Mark writes the Beliefs column for the New York Times, and is the author of the e-book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Predator-Upper-East-Kindle-Single-ebook/dp/B00GMVTPYI">The Zen Predator of The Upper East Side</a>. He is an expert on how religious and philosophical communities deal--or refuse to deal--with allegations of abuse in their ranks. </div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;"> </div>

      <description><![CDATA[<div style="color: #222222; font-size: 13px; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">It’s been ten years since the publication of Sam Harris’s book <em><a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://www.samharris.org/the-end-of-faith">The End of Faith</a></em> kicked off the cultural phenomenon of “new atheism,” bringing frank criticism of religion into mainstream conversation. In the decade since, Harris has emerged as something of a maverick among nonbelievers and progressives, frequently at the center of controversy with his opinions on Islam and extremism, science’s role in morality, and his embrace of a kind of “spiritualism” grounded in science.</div>

<div style="color: #222222; font-size: 13px; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">On this special episode of <em>Point of Inquiry</em>, Harris talks to host Josh Zepps about his foray into the mystical. In this fascinating interview, Harris asserts that experiences such as bliss and transcendence must be removed from the realm of sectarianism, but that “one of the great holes in secularism” is that “we don’t have a ready answer for someone who wakes up <span tabindex="0" data-term="goog_2141503784">tomorrow</span> morning with an extraordinary change in their conscious life which they deem positive.” </div>

That's why the World Health Organization has deployed med anthros to combat prior Ebloa outbreaks.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[One hundred years ago, Great Britain declared war on Germany, joining in what we now refer to as World War I, a conflict which cost more than 9 million combatants and 7 million civilians their lives, and shaped the the world we know today. How did reasonable people let "The Great War" begin, and what can reasonable people today learn from it? Joining us this week is Christopher Capozzola, an MIT professor in political and legal history, war, and the military, and author of <em><a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Uncle-Sam-Wants-You-American/dp/0199734798" target="_blank">Uncle Sam Wants You: World War I and the Making of the Modern American Citizen.</a></em> How did rational people plummet themselves into the irrationalism and chaos that tore apart the continent of Europe along with the rest of the world while sowing the seeds of much of the 20th Century's subsequent horrors?

He explains that despite legitimate concerns about stereotyping Muslims or racial profiling, this resolution equates any criticism or satire of religious beliefs with bigotry. He contrasts Europe's position on free speech with the United States' and how it is used by Islamic countries to justify their blasphemy laws, which often carry mandatory sentences of death or life in prison. He talks about how the Organization of the Islamic Conference at the United Nations aims to build into international human rights such legal standards that actually outlaw offensive speech against religions.

What can Western liberals do to help moderates in these countries lessen the influence of Islam's radicals? Does any cultural action on the part of the West do more harm than good?

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[This week, <i>Point of Inquiry </i>is delighted to welcome Ann Druyan, co-writer and co-creator of both the original <i>Cosmos: A Personal Voyage</i>, starring her late husband Carl Sagan, as well as the new series, <i>Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey</i>, starring Neil deGrasse Tyson. In a wide-ranging discussion, Druyan talks to Josh Zepps about how the first <i>Cosmos </i>series<i> </i>came to be, her efforts to translate the majesty of science into relatable and accessible storytelling, and how we've progressed toward making a more reasonable and humane society. We also get a little bit of insight into what it was like to get to know Carl Sagan for the first time. Ann Druyan co-wrote with Sagan the books <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Comet-Carl-Sagan/dp/0345412222/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1396887775&sr=1-1&keywords=comet+Sagan" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;"><i>Comet</i></a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shadows-Forgotten-Ancestors-Carl-Sagan/dp/0345384725/ref=pd_sim_b_7?ie=UTF8&refRID=0P1R84BXFFTG6TVBJHNT" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;"><i>Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors</i></a>, and sections of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle/dp/0345409469/ref=pd_sim_b_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=0DXB93KZW8HFFT7S5NGP" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;"><i>The Demon-Haunted World</i></a>.

He gives us an exclusive glimpse inside one of the most culturally influential shows in America.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">
<div dir="ltr">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">This week, Point of Inquiry welcomes Jason Stanley, professor of philosophy at Yale and co-author of a provocative essay in last week’s New York Times entitled <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/is-the-united-states-a-racial-democracy/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;"><i>Is the United States a ‘Racial Democracy?</i></a><i> </i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div dir="ltr" style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">Dr. Stanley and his co-author, Dr. Vesla Weaver, argue that the disproportionate surveillance, imprisonment, and post-conviction voter disenfranchisement of black Americans threatens the very integrity of our democracy. On any given day, 5.85 million people are unable to vote because they are in prison, on parole, or disenfranchised as felons. A disproportionate percentage of them are black. Of the nation's 2.3 million prisoners, about 1 million are black, despite the fact that black people represent just 13% of the population. If current trends continue, 1 in 3 black men born today can expect to go to prison in his lifetime. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">You don't even have to get arrested to be affected by the surveillance state. New research shows that any unwanted contact with police, even something as relatively brief as a stop-and-frisk, makes the target less likely to vote. Approximately 85% of those who were stopped and frisked in New York City last year were black or Latino. </p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr" style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">The essay raises pointed questions of interest to any skeptical citizen: Why do we strip prisoners of the right to vote in the first place? Does our fervent belief in democracy and equality blind us to the realities of our political system? How does racially-charged propaganda advance certain views while subtly stifling conflicting perspectives? </p>
</div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">
<div dir="ltr">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;"><i>Racial Democracy</i> was a surprise breakout hit from the Times' philosophy blog. It rapidly became the ninth most-emailed and twelfth most-tweeted item on the entire New York Times website. Rarely does an essay that cites Plato, Aristotle, and Dewey beat out the <i>Modern Love</i> column, but this is an unusual essay.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Joyce found that adoption has become the hot new spiritual fad among U.S. evangelicals, often with devastating consequences for children and families at home and abroad.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Evangelical adoption crusaders sell the idea that there are tens of millions of orphans just waiting to be “saved” by devout American parents. But the true number of orphans is much smaller. With pastors in mega-church pulpits exhorting their flocks to adopt, adopt, adopt, the demand for children now outstrips the supply leading to dubious activities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Orphanages in countries like Ethiopia and Guatemala have come under pressure to produce phony orphans for baby-hungry American consumers. Birth mothers are tricked into signing over their children. Most American families prefer young children with clean bills of health. So, adoptive parents are told their children are younger and healthier than they really are. International adoption can be a Wild West where almost anyone can adopt any number of children. Some parents adopt several children at a time because it's cheaper in bulk.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Point of Inquiry, Josh Zepps welcomes P.J. O’Rourke, humorist, cultural commentator, and best selling author of sixteen books. An early proponent of “gonzo journalism” and is a self-described libertarian, O’Rourke has served as editor-in-chief of National Lampoon, and has spent 20 years reporting for Rolling Stone and The Atlantic as the world’s only “trouble spot humorist,” going to wars, riots, rebellions, and other “Holidays in Hell” in more than 40 countries. O'Rourke is the H. L. Mencken Research Fellow at the Cato Institute and a frequent panelist on National Public Radio's game show Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! </p>
<p></p>
<p>In this episode they discuss everything from abortion and privacy, to the party following the fall of the Berlin Wall, to the looting of the Baghdad Museum. They are, however, able to steer clear of the dicey topic of free will.</p>]]></description>

In the meantime, enjoy these classic episodes from the POI archives, featuring Neil deGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, Susan Jacoby, and other luminaries in the science and secularism movement.</em></p>
<p>Our guest this week needs little introduction—he may be our most famous public communicator of science.</p>
<p>He's Neil DeGrasse Tyson, renowned American astrophysicist, director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History, and the host of PBS's <em>NOVA ScienceNow</em>, which just completed a new six part season.</p>
<p>Tyson is also the author of 9 books, most recently <em>Death By Black Hole and Other Cosmic Quandaries</em>, which was a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, and <em>The Pluto Files: The Rise and Fall of America's Favorite Planet</em>. </p>
<p>In this double length episode, Tyson discusses a wide range of topics: the just finished 2011 season of <em>ScienceNow</em>; how to restore a science "Zeitgeist" in our culture; Bill O'Reilly's recent foot-in-mouth comments about how the world works; this million-view <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_2xGIwQfik" target="_blank">YouTube clip of Tyson and Richard Dawkins</a>; and much more. </p>]]></description>

<p>Recently in New Orleans, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry held the very first CSIcon—the conference dedicated to scientific inquiry and critical thinking.</p>
<p>The main honoree: Bill Nye the Science Guy, who was given CSI's premiere "In Praise of Reason" award.</p>
<p>The next day, <em>Point of Inquiry</em> caught up with Nye, a guest who really needs no introduction... at least not to the thousands upon thousands of kids who saw a little show called <em>Bill Nye the Science Guy</em>.</p>
<p>Since then, Nye has been involved in many other endeavors and television programs to improve science teaching and understanding in our country, including his latest show on Planet Green, "<em>Stuff Happens</em>".</p>
<p>Nye is an engineer, inventor, author, comedian—a supporter of clean energy, and above all a skeptic.</p>]]></description>

<p>According to the USDA, Americans produce and consume more beef, veal, and chicken than any other nation in the world. As a result, the status of animal welfare in the meat production industry should be of some concern to all Americans, regardless of dietary habits. One of the world's leading experts in livestock handling practices is Dr. Temple Grandin, professor of animal science at Colorado State University.</p>
<p>In addition to gaining international recognition for her research on animal behavior and designs of feed yards and slaughterhouses, Dr. Grandin is also arguably the most famous high-functioning autistic adult. Her story has inspired countless individuals and families who have been touched by autism spectrum disorders, as well as other conditions that cause sensory hypersensitivity. In 2010, Claire Danes won both Emmy and Golden Globe awards for her portrayal of Temple in the critically-acclaimed HBO biopic <em>Temple Grandin</em>.</p>
<p>This week on <em>Point of Inquiry</em>, we talk to Grandin about science, animal behavior, autism, ethics, and much more.</p>
<p><strong>Temple Grandin</strong> teaches courses on livestock behavior and facility design at Colorado State University and consults with the livestock industry on facility design, livestock handling, and animal welfare. She has appeared on television shows such as <em>20/20</em>, <em>48 Hours</em>, <em>CNN Larry King Live</em>, <em>PrimeTime Live</em>, the <em>Today Show</em>, and many shows in other countries. She has been featured in <em>People Magazine</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Forbes</em>, <em>U.S. News and World Report</em>, <em>Time Magazine</em>, the <em>New York Times book review</em>, and <em>Discover</em> magazine. In 2010, <em>Time </em>Magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people. She has also authored over 400 articles in both scientific journals and livestock periodicals on animal handling, welfare, and facility design. She is the author of <em>Thinking in Pictures</em>, <em>Livestock Handling and Transport</em>, <em>Genetics and the Behavior of Domestic Animals</em>, and <em>Humane Livestock Handling</em>. Her books <em>Animals in Translation</em> and <em>Animals Make Us Human</em> were both on the <em>New York Times</em> best seller list.</p>]]></description>

<p>Our guest this week is an inspiring thinker whom we've wanted to get on the show for a long, long time: <strong>Ethan Zuckerman</strong>.</p>
<p>He's the director of the Center for Civic Media at MIT, and works at MIT's Media Lab. He's also the co-founder of <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/">Global Voices</a>, a community of global bloggers—and has worked in the past at Geekcorps and Tripod.</p>
<p>We're here to discuss his new book <em>Rewire: Digital Cosmopolitans in the Age of Connection—</em>which among other things argues that the technological ability to communicate with someone does not inevitably lead to increased human connection. In other words, it's about nothing less than how to use the Internet to open, rather than close, your mind.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>One thing we often forget about great scientists, especially as they are lionized and mythologized: they made mistakes. Sometimes big ones. Sometimes, even, brilliant ones.</p>
<p>Charles Darwin, for instance, didn't understand genetics. He and Gregor Mendel were as ships passing in the night. Granted, Darwin eventually realized that he needed a better theory of heredity in order for his idea of natural selection to work—so he came up with "pangenesis," a completely wrong idea that... well, the less said about it the better.</p>
<p>But Darwin isn't the only one. From Linus Pauling to Albert Einstein, many of history's greatest thinkers have blundered badly on occasion. They've made major mistakes—sometimes outright embarrassing ones. And now, acclaimed scientist and science writer Mario Livio has compiled these cases together into an intriguing narrative that helps us understand the importance of mistakes to science itself, and to how we think about it.</p>
<p><strong>Mario Livio</strong> is a senior astrophysicist at the Hubble Space Telescope Science Institute, and the author of more than 400 scientific papers. On top of that, he's also a popular science writer, author of books including <em>The Golden Ratio</em>, <em>The Equation that Couldn't Be Solved</em>, and <em>Is God a Mathematician?</em> His latest book, <em>Brilliant Blunders: From Darwin to Einstein, Colossal Mistakes By Great Scientists That Changed Our Understanding of Life and the Universe</em>, is the subject of our interview.</p>]]></description>

<p>From 9-11, to the death of Osama bin Laden, to the Boston Bombings, there's been a consistently bizarre and troubling reaction by some members of the public.</p>
<p>We're referring to the people—a minority, to be sure, but a surprisingly large one—who always seem to think there's some kind of cover up. The U.S. government, they feel, was <em>really</em> behind the attacks on, uh, itself. And as for Bin Laden—well, he isn't <em>really</em> dead.</p>
<p>These people are called conspiracy theorists, and, their particular form of irrationality is uniquely befuddling. It has been often denounced, but rarely understood. That's too bad, because conspiratorial thinking clearly plays an important role in science denial, on matters ranging from the connection between HIV and AIDS, to the safety of vaccines, to global warming.</p>
<p>Fortunately, conspiracy mongers are now becoming the subject of research and study—and our latest guest is helping to lead this inquiry.</p>
<p>His name is <strong>Stephan Lewandowsky</strong>, and he's a professor at the school of psychology at the University of Western Australia, and at the University of Bristol in the UK. And he's the author of a recent study with the delicious title "<a href="http://websites.psychology.uwa.edu.au/labs/cogscience/documents/LskyetalPsychScienceinPressClimateConspiracy.pdf">NASA Faked the Moon Landings, Therefore (Climate) Science is a Hoax: An Anatomy of the Motivated Rejection of Science</a> (PDF)"—which drew some small amount of attention, especially when it was followed by a second study of the conspiracy theorists who rejected the first study for, yes, conspiratorial reasons.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Indre Viskontas</p>
<p>In the science section at your local bookstore, you'll find plenty of books on everything from the brain, to the climate, to the cosmos.</p>
<p>But how many books will you find that take you on a tour of the digestive tract—from our mouths, to our stomachs, to our intestines? Popular science writer Mary Roach's new book, <em>Gulp</em>, does just that.</p>
<p>Decoding the science of taboo topics like vaginal weight-lifting, amputee bowling leagues, and how much food it takes to burst a human stomach has become the signature style of Roach, who has been described by the <em>Washington Post</em> as "America's funniest science writer."</p>
<p><strong> Mary Roach</strong> writes about human bodies in unusual circumstances and does not shy away from things that are gross. Her previous best-selling books include: <em>Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers</em>, <em>Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife</em>, <em>Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex</em>, and <em>Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void</em> but today we’ll be discussing <em>Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal</em>.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>Back in the summer of 2011—just before the 10 year anniversary of 9/11—this show welcomed on Scott Atran, an anthropologist who is a leading expert on terrorism and violent extremism.</p>
<p>Now, in the wake of the Boston bombings and the dramatic capture of suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, we called Atran back to discuss the first large scale U.S. terrorist bombing since 9/11.</p>
<p>As Atran's research shows, the Tsarnaev brothers share many parallels with other young, disaffected men who opt for extremist violence around the world.</p>
<p>But Atran's broader conclusion from the past week may be an unsettling one: When we devote such massive societal attention to a few homegrown terrorists, we may not ultimately be doing ourselves any favors.</p>
<p><strong> Scott Atran</strong> is an anthropologist and an expert on terrorism with appointments at John Jay College, the University of Michigan, and Oxford. He is author of the book <em>Talking to the Enemy: Faith, Brotherhood, and the (un)Making of Terrorists</em>, and in his research has personally interviewed mujahidin, Hamas, and the plotters behind the Bali bombing.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>We've all heard the claim: Academia is liberal. And it indoctrinates students.</p>
<p>It kills their religious faith and basically—or at least, so the allegation goes—transforms them into unkempt, pot-smoking hippies.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this claim is precisely half true. Yes, academia is really liberal. But no, this has virtually nothing at all to do with ideological brainwashing.</p>
<p>That's the provocative claim of a new book by Neil Gross of the University of British Columbia. It's entitled <em>Why Are Professors Liberal? And Why Do Conservatives Care?</em> And basically, it's a powerful data analysis to bandy about whenever Ted Cruz, or Rick Santorum, start talking about liberal academic indoctrination mills.</p>
<p><strong>Neil Gross</strong> taught at the University of Southern California and Harvard University before joining the University of British Columbia faculty in 2008. Trained at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Ph.D., 2002), and holding a BA in Legal Studies from the University of California, Berkeley (1992), Gross has special interests in sociological theory, politics, the sociology of ideas and academic life, and the sociology of culture. He is the editor of <em>Sociological Theory</em>, a quarterly journal of the American Sociological Association.</p>]]></description>

<p>Remember all the greatest hits of religious apologists—the ontological, cosmological, and teleological arguments for God's existence?</p>

<p>But Grayling isn't just making a negative case—his book is about how to live, and flourish, without religion in your life. It's about how to be good—and in the end about why, to find meaning, it's important most of all to <em>think</em>.</p>
<p><strong> A.C. Grayling</strong> is master of New College of the Humanities, and a Supernumerary Fellow of St. Anne's College, Oxford. He has written and edited over thirty books on philosophy and other topics—including <em>The Good Book</em>, <em>Ideas That Matter</em>, <em>Liberty in the Age of Terror</em>, and <em>To Set Prometheus Free</em>.</p>]]></description>

<p>You hear it a lot from religious believers: Faith is about doing good works, bringing about good in the world, and showing compassion.</p>
<p>In fact, some go further and argue that you can't really be moral without religion.</p>
<p>Well, says primatologist Frans de Waal, they really ought to take a look at our close cousin the bonobo—in his new book <em>The Bonobo and the Atheist</em>.</p>
<p>For that matter, De Waal continues, those defending a faith-only version of morality ought to look at any number of moral, empathetic behaviors throughout the animal kingdom, in species ranging from dogs to elephants.</p>
<p>De Waal's conclusions from all of this, for atheists, though, are controversial. He wants a more secular morality, but also thinks you can't just wipe religion away, because it is too closely wrapped up with our evolved morality and our group allegiances.</p>
<p>So we wanted to interview De Waal about the latest science on morality—and about what it means for those who want the world to try running a more <em>secular </em>operating system.</p>
<p><strong>Frans de Waal</strong> is a celebrated primatologist who directs the Living Links Center at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, and is the C.W. Candler professor of psychology at Emory University. He has written widely about our primate relatives, in books that include <em>Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape and The Age of Empathy</em>.</p>]]></description>

<p>Back in February, Yahoo!

It's a decision that impacts families with children in a big way—and puts a focus on women in the workplace.</p>
<p>Are decisions like Mayer's related to a broader cultural bias against women? Do biological differences between men and women account for the gender disparity in leadership positions in many industries? What do we even know about gender differences? Does science have answers to any of these questions yet? To find out, we invited Carol Tavris, a noted social psychologist and a pioneer of gender studies, to join us in this week's episode.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>Later this year, May 17 to 19 in Washington, D.C., the Center for Inquiry will convene its <a href="http://www.womeninsecularism.org">second "Women in Secularism" conference</a>.</p>
<p>There are a host of great speakers, many of whom we've had on this show before, like Susan Jacoby, Jennifer Michael Hecht, Greta Christina, and Rebecca Watson.</p>
<p>And we're going to be there covering it.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>I'm a big defender of the proposition that when it comes to abusing science, the political left and the political right are very different beasts.</p>
<p>But that doesn't make the left innocent of science abuses—and one man who knows that very well is Mark Lynas.</p>
<p>He's a British environmentalist and author, and he recently gained dramatic attention for his <a href="http://www.marklynas.org/2013/01/lecture-to-oxford-farming-conference-3-january-2013/">public conversion</a> on the issue GM crops—denouncing his prior allies, and also his prior self, on the issue.</p>
<p>Lynas had been an anti-GM activist and even a destroyer of crops. Now, he thinks science leads to a very different conclusion. He's also a defender of science on other issues where one can make a pretty serious case that the Left gets it wrong—like nuclear power.</p>
<p>So I wanted to bring Mark on to discuss anti-science on the left—and finally, to weigh the irrationality of the political poles and see if the scales are really balanced... or not.</p>
<p>Mark Lynas is a British journalist and environmental activist. He is the author of three books, most recently <em>The God Species: How the Planet Can Survive the Age of Humans</em>.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Indre Viskontas</p>
<p>Even the hard-core skeptics believe in magic, says Matthew Hutson in his new book <em>The 7 Laws of Magical Thinking: How Irrational Beliefs Keep us Happy, Healthy and Sane</em> which has just been released in paperback.</p>
<p>Most of us have some sentimental objects that would seem to lose their importance if replaced by an exact copy. We imbue our pets with human personality traits. We are disgusted at the thought of eating a cake that looks like fecal matter. We expect that what goes around comes around. All of these are examples of magical thinking, Hutson argues. A skeptic and an atheist, Hutson claims that ‘our ongoing flirtation with supernaturalism is a relationship that we depend on for survival.' I'm not convinced. In a lively discussion, we delve into magical thinking, its pitfalls and potential benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Hutson</strong> is a former editor at <em>Psychology Today</em>, and has a B.Sc. in cognitive neuroscience from Brown University and an M.S. in science writing from MIT.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Note: You can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJckLUkh9q0">watch this episode on Youtube</a>.</strong> </p>
<p>Since the horrendous massacre of children and teachers in Newtown, CT last year, gun control and the second amendment have been frequent topics of the national conversation. <em>Point of Inquiry</em> would be remiss if we didn't add our signature long-form interview style to the discussion. To that end, we interviewed Steven Pinker whose recent book suggests that we are, contrary to popular belief, living in the most peaceful time in humanity's existence.</p>
<p><strong>Steven Pinker</strong> is professor of psychology at Harvard University. He is the author of eight books, including <em>How the Mind Works</em>, <em>The Blank Slate</em>, <em>The Language Instinct</em> and most recently <em>The Better Angels of our Nature: Why Violence has Declined</em>. He is a two-time Pulitzer-prize finalist, one of <em>Time</em>'s 100 Most Influential People and one of Foreign Policy's top 100 Global Thinkers.</p>
<p>Also featured is an interview with Tom Di Liberto, meteorologist at NOAA and winner of the 2013 America's Science Idol contest.</p>
<p>This episode was recorded live at the 2013 AAAS Annual Meeting in Boston and was produced by Adam Isaak. The event was sponsored by the Center for Inquiry and the National Science Foundation.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This year's flu season has been dubbed the worst in recent history, despite the fact that the flu vaccine is fairly effective and readily available. But of course, not everyone experiencing flu-like symptoms actually has the flu—with so many cold viruses and bacterial infections being passed around, it seems that everyone has been sick this January. Long nights, low humidity, holiday parties all combine to create the perfect breeding ground for the tiny organisms that make us miserable.</p>
<p>Singers like myself are particularly sensitive to illnesses that make it impossible for us to do our jobs and so, as I traveled to Raleigh last week for a conference of science writers, journalists, bloggers and broadcasters, I couldn't help but think about bugs and viruses in between hand washings. It's no surprise then, that when I had the opportunity to chat with one of the most prolific and popular science writers in the world—Carl Zimmer—we climbed through the looking glass and into the microscopic realm of germs.</p>
<p><strong>Carl Zimmer</strong> is an award-winning science writer whose work is often published in the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>National Geographic</em>, <em>Time</em>, <em>Scientific American</em>, and other outlets.</p>
<p>His books include a history of neuroscience called <em>Soul Made Flesh</em>, <em>Parasite Rex</em>, and <em>Science Ink: Tattoos of the Science Obsessed</em>.</p>
<p>He is also a co-author of 3 critically-acclaimed textbooks on evolution and his popular blog <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/blog/the-loom/">The Loom</a> is now hosted by <em>National Geographic</em>. A popular public speaker and a frequent guest on Radiolab and This American Life, Zimmer is also the only science writer after whom a species of tapeworm has been named.</p>]]></description>

<p>We are thrilled by our guest this week, who is not only one of the world's most famous economists and economics commentators, but also a Nobel Laureate in his field: <strong>Paul Krugman</strong>.</p>
<p>In case he needs any introduction: He is a professor of economics at Princeton and a columnist for the <em>New York Times</em>, as well of the author of the blog on its website entitled "<a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/">The Conscience of a Liberal</a>."</p>
<p>The occasion for our interview is the release of his latest book, <em>End this Depression Now</em>, in paperback. It is just out and, besides being a very lucid explanation of our current economic predicament, it is also a work that goes straight at the heart of a central concern of this show—what is science, and what isn't, in a field that is perhaps even more political than other aspects of science... economics.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>Our guest this week is Sean Carroll—theoretical physicist at CalTech, and skilled science communicator.</p>
<p>I've known Sean and his work for almost a decade, and I've invited him on to talk about his latest book: <em>The Particle at the End of the Universe: How the Higgs Boson Leads Us to the Edge of a New World</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Sean Carroll</strong> is a physicist at the California Institute of Technology. His research focuses on theoretical physics and cosmology, especially the origin and constituents of the universe. He has contributed to models of interactions between dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter; alternative theories of gravity; and violations of fundamental symmetries. Carroll is also the author of <em>From Eternity to Here: The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time</em>.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p> <p>Our guest this week is Sean Carroll—theoretical physicist at CalTech, and skilled science communicator.</p> <p>I've known Sean and his work for almost a decade, and I've invited him on to talk about his latest book: <em>The Particle at the End of the Universe: How the Higgs Boson Leads Us to the Edge of a New World</em>.</p> <p>Sean Carroll is a physicist at the California Institute of Technology. His research focuses on theoretical physics and cosmology, especially the origin and constituents of the universe. He has contributed to models of interactions between dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter; alternative theories of gravity; and violations of fundamental symmetries. Carroll is also the author of <em>From Eternity to Here: The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time</em>. He has appeared on TV shows such as The Colbert Report and Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman, and frequently serves as a science consultant for film and television.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>This is our first show of 2013, and notably, <strong>we're still here</strong>.</p>
<p>A lot of people actually thought the world was going to end at the end of last year, which, presumably, means that now it's rejoicing time.</p>
<p>And also reflection time. Time for reflection on all the things that people are capable of believing, as well as the things that might really lead to global catastrophe someday.</p>
<p>To help us in that process, we've invited back our expert on all things related to the world ending and not ending: Phil Plait.</p>
<p>He needs no introduction, except to say that he's the Bad Astronomer. He's the <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy.html">Bad Astronomer at Slate</a>, on <a href="https://twitter.com/BadAstronomer">Twitter</a>, and on every other platform you can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>Phil Plait</strong> is an astronomer, lecturer, and author. After ten years working on Hubble Space Telescope data and six more working on astronomy education, he struck out on his own as a writer. His two books are <em>Bad Astronomy: Misconceptions and Misuses Revealed, from Astrology to the Moon Landing "Hoax"</em> and <em>Death from the Skies! These Are the Ways the Universe Will End</em>.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Indre Viskontas</p>
<p>It's become almost a truism that in their spare time, skeptics tend to gravitate towards TV shows, novels and games that portray the very monsters, myths and conspiracies that they work so hard to debunk. A great story is just as entertaining to the most hardened skeptics as it is to the rest of the population. And because they are often more knowledgeable about the history of a particular monster or myth, skeptics might even enjoy fictional depictions of pet topics more than the uninitiated general public.</p>
<p>A case in point is author and podcaster Scott Sigler, whose fascination with monsters led him not only to read and watch stories about monsters, but even to invest all of his creative energy and talent into writing horrifying and thrilling science fiction novels. But is there a risk of propagating myths through storytelling? Does science fiction help or hurt critical thinking? To get some insights into these questions, we talked to Scott about his writing process, his characters and what truths we can learn about ourselves through fiction.</p>
<p><em> New York Times</em> best-selling novelist <strong>Scott Sigler</strong> is the author of <em>Nocturnal</em>, <em>Ancestor</em>, <em>Infected</em>, and <em>Contagious</em>, hardcover thrillers from Crown Publishing, and the co-founder of Dark Øverlord Media, which publishes his Galactic Football League series. Before he was published, Scott built a large online following by giving away his self-recorded audiobooks as free, serialized podcasts. His loyal fans, who call themselves "Junkies," have downloaded over fifteen million individual episodes of his stories and interact daily with Scott and each other in the social media space. Scott reinvented book publishing when he released <em>Earthcore</em> as the world's first "podcast-only" novel, harkening back to the days of serialized radio fiction. He's been covered in <em>Time</em> magazine, the <em>Washington Post</em>, the<em> New York Times</em>, the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>, and <em>The Huffington Post</em>, among others. He still records his own audiobooks and gives away every story-for free-to his Junkies at <a href="http://www.scottsigler.com">ScottSigler.com</a>.</p>]]></description>

<p>But for this show, I packed up my gear and hailed a cab—to the Center for Inquiry's brand new Office of Public Policy in downtown, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The Center for Inquiry is here to literally make this country listen to reason... and science. It's a sensibility that is simply in far too short of a supply in this town.</p>
<p>So I sat down with Ronald A. Lindsay, CFI's president, and Michael De Dora, head of the Office of Public Policy, to talk about their plans to make our legislators and leaders just a little more rational and science based.</p>
<p><strong>Ronald A. Lindsay</strong> is president and CEO of the Center for Inquiry and its affiliates, the Council for Secular Humanism and the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. He has led the organization since 2008.</p>

<p>Many of them are young. And many of them are terrified at what is happening to the planet that, in his last book, McKibben renamed "Eaarth," because, he said, the old name just didn't really capture it any longer.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Indre Viskontas</p>
<p>Because we live in an uncertain world, we arm ourselves with facts to gain a sense of control and therefore some modicum of comfort. We know that the sun will rise tomorrow even though it disappears tonight. But what happens when facts, those bits of information that we believed captured some fundamental truth about our world, are shown to be no longer true? With the exponential rise in our knowledge about our universe comes a tsunami of data overturning what we once thought we knew with complete certainty. Are there patterns that emerge from this wasteland of myths that once were accepted facts.</p>
<p>One tried and true solution is to apply math to the problem, and network scientist and author Samuel Arbesman has done just that in his recently published book on the Half-life of Facts.</p>
<p><strong>Samuel Arbesman</strong> is an applied mathematician and network scientist. He is a Senior Scholar at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and a fellow at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard University. In addition, he blogs at Wired.com, and his essays about math and science have appeared in such places as the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>The Atlantic</em>, and the Ideas section of the <em>Boston Globe</em>. Prior to joining the Kauffman Foundation, Arbesman was a research fellow in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School, where he used network science and applied mathematics to study innovation, scientific discovery, and prosocial behavior. He completed a PhD in computational biology at Cornell University in 2008, and earned a BA in computer science and biology at Brandeis University in 2004. He has also coined a new word, named an asteroid, and created an eponymous constant and the Milky Way Transit Authority subway map.</p>]]></description>

Are there patterns that emerge from this wasteland of myths that once were accepted facts.</p> <p>One tried and true solution is to apply math to the problem, and network scientist and author Samuel Arbesman has done just that in his recently published book on the Half-life of Facts.</p> <p>Samuel Arbesman is an applied mathematician and network scientist. He is a Senior Scholar at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and a fellow at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard University. In addition, he blogs at Wired.com, and his essays about math and science have appeared in such places as the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>The Atlantic</em>, and the Ideas section of the <em>Boston Globe</em>. Prior to joining the Kauffman Foundation, Arbesman was a research fellow in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School, where he used network science and applied mathematics to study innovation, scientific discovery, and prosocial behavior. He completed a PhD in computational biology at Cornell University in 2008, and earned a BA in computer science and biology at Brandeis University in 2004. He has also coined a new word, named an asteroid, and created an eponymous constant and the Milky Way Transit Authority subway map.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>One of the first people I ever got to know in skepticism was Steven Novella.</p>
<p>He was a professor at Yale, just starting out as an organized skeptic—I was a student, just getting fired up about the same stuff.</p>
<p>Since then, Steve has become hugely successful as a skeptic leader and as a communicator of skeptical ideas, particularly when it comes to his area of specialty, alternative medicine.</p>
<p>And one thing I've always noticed about him over the years is his unending capacity to consider what really works to promote skepticism and critical thinking, and what doesn't—and to adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>So I asked Steve on the show to discuss this process, and to talk about grappling with one of the toughest issues in skepticism and the issue that is his personal specialty—dealing with false claims about medical cures, or what is sometimes called complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).</p>
<p><strong>Steven Novella</strong> is a neurologist at the Yale University School of Medicine. He's also the host of the podcast Skeptics' Guide to the Universe, and the president and co-founder of the New England Skeptics' Society. He writes the blog Neurologica, and contributes to a number of other blogs including Science-Based Medicine.</p>]]></description>

<p>Before the "complementary and alternative medicine" fad, and before UFO craze, lived a man whom you might call the first modern pseudoscientist.</p>
<p>His name was Immanuel Velikovsky. He had a strange theory about a comet—that turned out to be Venus—shaping the course of human history.</p>
<p>He tangled with Carl Sagan about it—and with the scientific community about it. And then, he was mostly forgotten.</p>
<p>But no longer, because Princeton historian of science Michael Gordin has tracked down Velikovsky's personal papers. In his book <em>The Pseudoscience Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe</em>, Gordin uses Velikovsky's example to show how he laid the groundwork for other pseudosciences-it's kind of like they followed in his footsteps.</p>
<p>Michael Gordin is professor of history at Princeton University and director of the program in Russian and Eurasian Studies. He has written widely in the history of science with a focus on the Soviet Union and the early nuclear age. <em>The Pseudoscience Wars</em> is his fourth book.</p>]]></description>

<p>Our guest this week, Jacques Berlinerblau, has a provocative thesis about all this. He says that American secularism has clearly and distinctly lost major ground. And to recover from that loss, well... he's got some suggestions that might not go down well—but it's important to hear them.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Indre Viskotnas</p>
<p>Despite our individual differences, highlighted especially during an election, much of what we see, hear, smell or feel is shareable: that is, when standing in front of an object, we can more or less agree that it has a particular color, shape, texture, size and so on. But what if I tell you that I see an object clearly which you do not? Or hear a voice that doesn't have a physical source? Now we enter the world of hallucinations.</p>
<p>Hallucinations, or perceptions of objects without an external reality, are not confined to the minds of people with schizophrenia or those who take hallucinogenic drugs. In many cultures, visions are considered a privileged state of consciousness; the trait of a special person chosen by some supernatural force to pass along an important message. But in our western worldview, hallucinations are often associated with a malfunctioning brain. What causes the startling, unbidden perception of something that seems very real, but has no material existence outside of our own minds?</p>
<p>With reference to his own mind-altering experiences, the 'poet-laureate of medicine', Dr. Oliver Sacks, takes us through the looking glass and into the fascinating world of hallucinations.</p>
<p><strong>Oliver Sacks</strong>, M.D. is a physician, a best-selling author, and a professor of neurology at the NYU School of Medicine.</p>
<p>He is best known for his collections of neurological case histories, including <em>The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat</em> (1985), <em>Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain</em> (2007) and <em>The Mind's Eye</em> (2010). <em>Awakenings</em> (1973), his book about a group of patients who had survived the great encephalitis lethargica epidemic of the early twentieth century, inspired the 1990 Academy Award-nominated feature film starring Robert De Niro and Robin Williams.</p>
<p>Dr. Sacks is a frequent contributor to the <em>New Yorker</em> and the <em>New York Review of Books</em>, and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Letters as well as the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His new book, <em>Hallucinations</em> (2012), has just been released.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Hosts: Indre Viskontas and Chris Mooney</p>
<p>At the 2012 CSICON conference in Nashville, Tennessee, your <em>Point of Inquiry</em> hosts Indre Viskontas and Chris Mooney finally actually found themselves in the same place. The result was a show that features both of them covering current events—the 2012 election, the passing of CFI founder Paul Kurtz—and each also conducting an interview!</p>
<p>Our guests:</p>
<p><strong>Jon Ronson</strong> (interviewed by Chris Mooney) is a journalist, filmmaker, radio personality and humorist-author of books you have heard of like <em>The Men Who Stare at Goats</em> and <em>The Psychopath Test</em>. You may have heard him on <em>This American Life</em>, or read him in the <em>Guardian—</em>or, if you are a very strange and odd person, or maybe a psychopath, you may have been interviewed by him! Because that would put you right in his wheelhouse, as he explains in this interview.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Wiseman</strong> (interviewed by Indre Viskontas) holds Britain's only Professorship in the Public Understanding of Psychology at the University of Hertfordshire. His research on an eclectic range of topics including luck, self-help, illusion and persuasion has been published in some of the world's leading academic journals and cited in over 20 introductory textbooks. He has also written several best-selling books that have been translated into over 30 languages, including <em>The Luck Factor</em>, <em>Quirkology</em>, and <em>59 Seconds</em>. His psychology-based YouTube videos have received over 45 million views and he has given keynote addresses to organisations across the world, including The Royal Society, The Swiss Economic Forum, and Google. Richard is the most followed British psychologist on Twitter and was recently listed in the Independent On Sunday's top 100 people who make Britain a better place to live.  Over 2 million people have taken part in his mass participation experiments and he has acted as a creative consultant to Derren Brown, The MythBusters, CBS's <em>The Mentalist</em>, Heston Blumenthal, Nick Cave and Jeremy Deller. He began his working life as a professional magician and is a member of The Inner Magic Circle.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Indre Viskontas</p>
<p>The month of October is associated with falling leaves, autumn winds and hallowe'en. But for sports fans in the US, it also signals a high point in America's national pastime: baseball's postseason. After a long run of 162 games, the last weeks of October are ripe with matchups in which legends are made and broken. Any skeptic worth his or her salt, however, can't help but marvel at the diversity and frequency of ritualistic behaviors on display amongst these world class athletes. What is it about baseball that cause intelligent, highly-motivated, elite athletes to refrain from washing their underwear, to eat fried chicken or crunchy taco supremes, to put pennies in their supporters after every win, or chew the same piece of gum night after night, saving it under a baseball cap? The repertoire of routines that batters engage in while stepping into the box is often as choreographed as a ballet: with commentators going so far as calling Mike Hargrove the human rain delay because of his extended dance.</p>
<p>To navigate this swamp of superstition, we talked to <strong>Bruce Hood</strong>, a Canadian-born experimental psychologist, whose popular book <em>SuperSense: Why We Believe in the Unbelievable</em>, has shed light on our tendency towards irrational behaviors. Professor Hood is the director of the Bristol Cognitive Development Centre at the University of Bristol, where he studies the origins of supernatural beliefs, intuitive theory formation, inhibitory control and general cognitive development. He has been awarded a Sloan Fellowship among other honors, and is a Fellow of the American Psychological Science society. In 2011, he delivered the Royal Institution Christmas lectures broadcast by the BBC to over 4 million viewers. His most recent book is the <em>Self Illusion</em>, which calls into question our view of ourselves as coherent, integrated individuals.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>In this show, we talk to two founders of ScienceDebate, a nonprofit organization that in the last two election cycles has pushed to get the presidential candidates to talk about and debate science policy.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no actual presidential science debate. But this year, ScienceDebate got Barack Obama and Mitt Romney to <a href="http://www.sciencedebate.org/debate12/">answer 14 top science policy questions</a>, leading to some revealing results. And with the election less than a month away—an election whose winner will guide science policy at a time when international research competitiveness, climate change, and other science based issues demand attention... it's hard to think of many things more important for voters to pay attention to.</p>
<p>The media feel otherwise, unfortunately. The first presidential debate and the vice-presidential debate have ignored science almost entirely. But that's precisely why we're here, and why ScienceDebate is here—to try to shine some light on the issues that matter critically, but aren't getting their due.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Chapman</strong> is a screenwriter, author, and great-great grandson of Charles Darwin. When not working on ScienceDebate, he recently wrote and directed <em>The Ledge</em>, a thriller whose central character is an atheist.</p>
<p><strong>Shawn Otto</strong> is also a screenwriter and author, most recently of the book <em>Fool me Twice: Fighting the Assault on Science in America</em>. Among other accolades, he also wrote and co-produced the Oscar nominated film <em>A House of Sand and Fog</em>.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>Our guest this week is <strong>Lisa Randall</strong>, the Harvard theoretical physicist and one of the most heavily cited and influential researchers in her field. She's a member of a number of distinguished scientific societies, including the National Academy of Sciences—but she's also a very popular science author, behind the bestselling <em>Warped Passages: Unraveling the Universe's Hidden Dimensions</em>, and more recently <em>Knocking on Heaven's Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate the Universe and the Modern World</em>, which is just out in paperback.</p>
<p>Between the hardback and paperback release of <em>Knocking on Heaven's Door</em>, a subject much discussed in the book—the quest for the discovery of the Higgs boson—was actually completed. Or at least, scientists at the Large Hadron Collider found a particle that sure looks like the Higgs.</p>
<p>Randall has a new e-book about this entitled <em>Higgs Discovery: The Power of Empty Space</em>. So we were thrilled to speak with her about the Higgs, and what the discovery means about the ability of physics to continually peel back new layers of the universe.</p>]]></description>

<p>It's called <em>Answers for Aristotle: How Science and Philosophy Can Lead Us to a More Meaningful Life</em>. And in it, Pigliucci lays out an approach that he calls "sci-phi."

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Indre Viskontas</p>
<p>There is no doubt that our world is populated with cheats and liars. Most of us, slaves to the availability heuristic, think of major cheaters like Bernie Madoff, Tiger Woods, and Barry Bonds as inflicting the most damage onto society. But just how honest are we, with others and with ourselves? The surprising finding from several studies conducted by Dan Ariely and his collaborators is that we all cheat. What's worse, the consequences of these little everyday deceptions can sometimes far outweigh the ill effects of even the biggest lies. Following up on his previous books demonstrating our irrationality, this week on <em>Point of Inquiry</em> Dan walks us through his account of the irrational forces that determine whether or not we behave ethically.</p>
<p><strong> Dan Ariely</strong> is the James B. Duke Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke University, with appointments at the Fuqua School of Business, the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, the Department of Economics, and the School of Medicine. Dan earned one PhD in cognitive psychology and another PhD in business administration. He is the founder and director of the Center for Advanced Hindsight. His work has been featured in many outlets, including <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>, <em>The Boston Globe</em>, and others. His two previous <em>New York Times</em> best-selling books are <em>Predictably Irrational</em> and <em>The Upside of Irrationality</em>.</p>]]></description>

<p>Wouldn't it be nice if there were a way to make American politics just a little more rational, just a little more evidence based?</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be even nicer if there was a website, or an app, that helped that process along?</p>
<p>Maybe, just maybe, a promising innovation called <a href="http://www.truthmarket.com/">TruthMarket</a> can help with the problem. It's a site where people who care about the truth crowd-fund campaigns dedicated to either proving the veracity of true claims, or the falsity of wrong ones... where, in essence, you make money by showing definitively that you're right.</p>
<p>The goal, of course, is to use market forces to vanquish truthiness... and, well, here's hoping that it works.</p>
<p>To talk about this new site, we've invited on its founder, Rick Hayes-Roth.</p>

<p>Several times on this show, we've discussed the topic of ideological asymmetry. In other words, are people of all political persuasions equally biased, equally prone to reasoning based on their emotions to support prior commitments?</p>
<p>A <a href="https://webfiles.uci.edu/phditto/peterditto/Publications/Liu%20%26%20Ditto%202012.pdf?uniq=-5wjp1a">new scientific paper</a> (PDF) has recently come out that reopens this question, so naturally, we had to invite on one of its authors. His name is Peter Ditto, and he's a social psychologist at the University of California-Irvine who has been a leader in the study of emotional, or motivated, reasoning.</p>
<p>At the same time, Ditto also studies the psychological foundations of political ideology more broadly. And in <em>another</em> recent paper, he and colleagues including Jonathan Haidt, provide a wealth of data on the personalities and motivations of people who choose to be libertarian. So we wanted to talk about that as well.</p>
<p><strong> Peter Ditto</strong> is department chair and professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California-Irvine. His research focuses on motivated reasoning and how our differing moral emotions tend to impel it—and how it is involved in partisan political biases.</p>
<p>The scientific papers discussed in this episode are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liu, B., & Ditto, P. H. (in press). "<a href="https://webfiles.uci.edu/phditto/peterditto/Publications/Liu%20%26%20Ditto%202012.pdf?uniq=-5wjp1a">What dilemma? Moral evaluation shapes factual belief.</a>" <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em>.</li>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Indre Viskontas</p>
<p>According to the USDA, Americans produce and consume more beef, veal, and chicken than any other nation in the world. As a result, the status of animal welfare in the meat production industry should be of some concern to all Americans, regardless of dietary habits. One of the world's leading experts in livestock handling practices is Dr. Temple Grandin, professor of animal science at Colorado State University.</p>
<p>In addition to gaining international recognition for her research on animal behavior and designs of feed yards and slaughterhouses, Dr. Grandin is also arguably the most famous high-functioning autistic adult. Her story has inspired countless individuals and families who have been touched by autism spectrum disorders, as well as other conditions that cause sensory hypersensitivity. In 2010, Clare Danes won both Emmy and Golden Globe awards for her portrayal of Temple in the critically-acclaimed HBO biopic <em>Temple Grandin</em>.</p>
<p>This week on <em>Point of Inquiry</em>, we talk to Grandin about science, animal behavior, autism, ethics, and much more.</p>
<p><strong>Temple Grandin</strong> teaches courses on livestock behavior and facility design at Colorado State University and consults with the livestock industry on facility design, livestock handling, and animal welfare. She has appeared on television shows such as <em>20/20</em>, <em>48 Hours</em>, <em>CNN Larry King Live</em>, <em>PrimeTime Live</em>, the <em>Today Show</em>, and many shows in other countries. She has been featured in <em>People Magazine</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Forbes</em>, <em>U.S. News and World Report</em>, <em>Time Magazine</em>, the <em>New York Times book review</em>, and <em>Discover</em> magazine. In 2010, <em>Time </em>Magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people. She has also authored over 400 articles in both scientific journals and livestock periodicals on animal handling, welfare, and facility design. She is the author of <em>Thinking in Pictures</em>, <em>Livestock Handling and Transport</em>, <em>Genetics and the Behavior of Domestic Animals</em>, and <em>Humane Livestock Handling</em>. Her books <em>Animals in Translation</em> and <em>Animals Make Us Human</em> were both on the <em>New York Times</em> best seller list.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>This week's guest is Joe Romm. You may know him as a top blogger on global warming and energy—but that's not why we're having him on.</p>
<p>In an impressive show of versatility, Romm the scientist has written a book about how to persuade people. It's entitled <em>Language Intelligence: Lessons on Persuasion from Jesus, Shakespeare, Lincoln, and Lady Gaga</em>. In essence, it's a treatise on the neglected art of rhetoric, the technique mastered by Shakespeare and the writers of the King James Bible.</p>
<p>In it, Romm delves deeply into figures of speech, and how they make orators persuasive by allowing them to activate people's emotions. Indeed, as Romm writes, modern neuroscience now confirms what the poets always knew about getting to people's heads through their hearts (that's a metaphor, by the way—one of the chief techniques that Romm discusses).</p>
<p>If you ever want to understand why scientists—and people devoted to reason and critical thinking—fare so poorly getting their message across, you are going to want to listen to this show.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Romm</strong> is a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress, and oversees the blog <a href="http://www.climateprogress.org">ClimateProgress.org</a>, which was named one of <em>Time </em>Magazine's Fifteen Favorite Websites for the Environment in 2007. He is also the author of several books, including <em>Hell and High Water: Global Warming—The Solution and The Politics</em>. He holds a Ph.D. in physics from MIT, and served as acting assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy during 1997 and principal deputy assistant secretary from 1995 through 1998.</p>]]></description>

<p>diCarlo is a Philosopher of Science and Ethics whose interests in cognitive evolution have taken him into the natural and social sciences. He is interested in how and why the human brain has evolved to its current state and what cross-cultural and cross-species behavior can provide insight into universally common modes of reasoning. He is also interested in the application of neuroscience (specifically fMRI work), in an effort to better understand psychoneuroendocrine feedback looping in problem solving. His most recent book is <em>How to Become a Really Good Pain in the Ass: A Critical Thinker's Guide to Asking the Right Questions.</em></p>

<p>Can people who care about secularism take America back from the religious right?</p>
<p>Of all the questions that concern us on this show, this is perhaps the most important, the most central, of all.</p>
<p>And David Niose has an answer to it. Simply put, he thinks we can.</p>
<p>In his new book, <em>Nonbeliever Nation: The Rise of Secular Americans</em>, Niose outlines the damage the religious right has done, and how the growing forces of secularity stand poised to finally effectively counter them.</p>
<p>Central to the strategy? Embracing the atheist, or at any rate, the secular identity, and wearing it proudly on one's sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>David Niose</strong> is an attorney and president of the Washington-based American Humanist Association.

Simply put, he thinks we can.</p> <p>In his new book, <em>Nonbeliever Nation: The Rise of Secular Americans</em>, Niose outlines the damage the religious right has done, and how the growing forces of secularity stand poised to finally effectively counter them.</p> <p>Central to the strategy? Embracing the atheist, or at any rate, the secular identity, and wearing it proudly on one's sleeve.</p> <p>David Niose is an attorney and president of the Washington-based American Humanist Association. He has appeared widely in national and international media advocating for secularism and humanism, and serves as vice president of the Secular Coalition for America.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>For this episode of <em>Point of Inquiry</em>, we tried something a little different. At Center for Inquiry headquarters in Amherst, NY, we filmed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXJT8v4HhY">a special hour long program</a> with multiple in-studio guests, including the famed atheist comedian Jamie Kilstein. As usual, the program is also available as an audio-only podcast.</p>
<p>In either format, here's what it contains:</p>
<p><strong> When Doubt is a Crime</strong>: Michael De Dora, director of the Center for Inquiry Office of Public Policy in Washington, D.C., discusses the disturbing case of an Indonesian man who was recently sentenced to two and a half years in prison, just for questioning whether God exists.</p>
<p><strong> Fox News Bashing, Redux</strong>: Chris Mooney responds to recent listener comments, some of them complimentary, some... not so much.</p>
<p><strong> From the Culture Wars to... Chuck Norris</strong>: We talk with Ed Brayton, the blogger behind <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/dispatches/">Dispatches from the Culture Wars</a> and owner of the <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/">FreethoughtBlogs network</a>, about recent church state issues—and his steady monitoring of everyone's favorite right wing karate menace.</p>
<p><strong> Gotta Keep ‘em Separated</strong>: We interview <a href="http://twitter.com/jessicaahlquist">Jessica Ahlquist</a>, the high school freethought activist who was recently victorious in her Rhode Island church-state lawsuit over a prayer banner displayed in her high school auditorium.</p>
<p><strong> Jamie Kilstein</strong>: The hilarious atheist comedian and host of <a href="http://wearecitizenradio.com">Citizen Radio</a> discusses how he became an atheist, the future of the 99 percent, mixed martial arts, and his fighting challenge to conservative pundit Jonah Goldberg.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Indre Viskontas</p>
<p>The idea that science moves forward by carefully peeling back layers of the onion of truth, one by one, in a deliberate fashion, is so prevalent that it borders on cliche. But the truth is that running scientific experiments often feels more akin to dipping a cup into a bottomless well of information: each new study simply raises more questions than it answers. Although scientific knowledge is vast, ignorance, or what's left to learn, dwarfs what we think we know. Exploring this boundless frontier, neurobiologist Stuart Firestein explains how ignorance, rather than facts, drives science.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Firestein</strong> is the Chair of Columbia University's Department of Biological Sciences where he studies the vertebrate olfactory system, possibly the best chemical detector on the face of the planet. Dedicated to promoting the accessibility of science to a public audience Firestein serves as an advisor for the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation's program for the Public Understanding of Science. His popular course at Columbia University served as the basis of his new book <em>Ignorance: How it Drives Science</em> published by Oxford University Press.</p>]]></description>

<p>Our guest this week is <strong>Chris Hayes</strong>, host of MSNBC's <em>Up With Chris Hayes</em> and editor at large of <em>The Nation</em>.</p>
<p>Hayes has come out with a much anticipated new book that makes a surprising argument. It's called <em>Twilight of the Elites: America After Meritocracy</em>, and in it, he attributes the stunning loss of trust in American institutions to, well, the system by which we chose who runs them.</p>
<p>That system is a meritocracy—and it's supposed to be a fair one in which people get ahead or fall behind based on their own inherent abilities. But in reality, Hayes says, inequality in, inequality out.</p>
<p>It's an intriguing and unexpected thesis, and after reading it, we wanted to ask Hayes about what this means for science in particular—which is, after all, a meritocracy. We also wanted to ask Hayes why people at the top of the totem pole—supposedly so smart, supposedly so well-trained and cultured—are in fact so poor at reasoning about those below them.</p>]]></description>

To get up to speed on the state of the art, we talked to Christof Koch, a colorful pioneer in the application of scientific tools to delineate the neural correlates of consciousness, whose famous 18-year collaboration with Francis Crick helped legitimize the field.

<p>Over the weekend, I was fortunate enough to attend the 2012 World Skeptics Conference in Berlin.</p>
<p>It's important to keep tabs on our skeptical and freethinking colleagues around the world, and the challenges they're facing. And in this case, perhaps the most disturbing story out of the conference involved the spread of a new form of creationism—namely, Islamic creationism—in Europe.</p>
<p>It's a topic I've wanted to explore on the show for some time. So in Berlin, I stopped to speak with Johan Braeckman, who has been tracking the subject closely.</p>
<p><strong>Johan Braeckman</strong> is a professor of philosophy of science at Ghent University in Belgium, and his research focuses on philosophical issues in the life sciences, particularly evolution and neuroscience. He's the author of a number of books and papers, including, most recently, <em>Doubting Thomas Has a Point: A Guide to Critical Thinking</em>, coauthored with Maarten Boudry.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>This week at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, a conference convened entitled "Science Writing in the Age of Denial." The keynote speaker was a former <em>Point of Inquiry</em> guest and a very popular one—Naomi Oreskes, co-author of the influential book <em>Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming</em>.</p>
<p><em> Point of Inquiry</em> caught up with Dr. Oreskes at the conference and interviewed her about her lecture there, entitled "Neoliberalism and the Denial of Global Warming."</p>
<p><strong> Naomi Oreskes</strong> is professor of history and science studies at the University of California, San Diego. Her 2010 book <em>Merchants of Doubt</em>, written with Eric Conway, described how a small group of scientists sought to undermine a large body of research on issues like global warming, the health risks of smoking, and ozone depletion. She is the author of the famed 2004 essay for the journal <em>Science</em> entitled "The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change," which was cited in the Academy Award winning film <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>.</p>]]></description>

<p>In this special episode of <em>Point of Inquiry</em>, we interview our host himself—about his new book, <em>The Republican Brain: The Science of Why They Deny Science and Reality</em>.</p>
<p>From climate change to evolution, the rejection of mainstream science among Republicans is growing, as is the denial of expert consensus on the economy, American history, foreign policy and much more. Why won't Republicans accept things that most experts agree on? Why are they constantly fighting against the facts?</p>
<p>Science writer and host of <em>Point of Inquiry</em> <strong>Chris Mooney</strong> explores brain scans, polls, and psychology experiments to explain why conservatives today believe more wrong things; appear more likely than Democrats to oppose new ideas and less likely to change their beliefs in the face of new facts; and sometimes respond to compelling evidence by doubling down on their current beliefs.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Indre Viskontas</p>
<p>The end is nigh. 2012 is a banner year for doomsday prophecies, though there still seems to be debate concerning precisely how life as we know it will be snuffed out. Hollywood seems to prefer the 'death from the skies' scenario, with Lars von Trier's latest film <em>Melancholia </em>exploring the psychological consequences of believing that another planet is on a collision course with ours. But would we know? How much warning would we receive if such a catastrophe were to occur?</p>
<p>There is no better source for this information than Dr. David Morrison, the founder of the field of astrobiology, or the study of life in the universe. Once the Director of Space at NASA Ames, he is best known for his work on assessing the risk of near earth objects such as asteroids and comets. As the mind behind the popular <a href="http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/ask-an-astrobiologist/">'Ask an Astrobiologist' blog</a> on NASA's website, Dr. Morrison has all the answers.</p>
<p><strong> David Morrison</strong> is the senior scientist at the NASA Astrobiology Institute, NASA Ames Research Center, where he participates in a variety of research programs in astrobiology—the study of the living universe. Dr. Morrison obtained his doctorate in astronomy from Harvard University. He is the author of more than 155 technical papers and has published a dozen books. He has been a science investigator on NASA's Mariner, Voyager and Galileo space missions. Morrison is recipient of the Dryden Medal for research of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the Sagan Medal of the American Astronomical Society for public communication, and the Klumpke-Roberts award of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific for contributions to science education. He has received two NASA Outstanding Leadership medals and he was awarded the Presidential Meritorious Rank for his work as director of space at NASA Ames. Morrison is perhaps best known for his leadership since 1991 in defining the hazard of asteroid impacts and seeking ways to mitigate this risk. Asteroid 2410 Morrison is named in his honor.</p>]]></description>

<p>Why is it that some of us are religious, some of us not... some of us liberal, some of us not?</p>
<p>If you've been paying attention, then by now you might have noticed that this doesn't really have a lot to do with the intellectual <em>validity </em>of religious, or irreligious, or liberal, or conservative ideas.</p>
<p>So what causes it? And why can't we all get along?</p>
<p>To get at this, Point of Inquiry invited on a scholar and thinker who has become famous for his scientific approach to this question—Jonathan Haidt, author of the new book <em>The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion</em>.<br /> <br /> Jonathan Haidt is a professor of social psychology at the University of Virginia, and a visiting professor of business ethics at the NYU-Stern School of Business. Haidt's research examines the intuitive foundations of morality, and how morality varies across cultures.

<p>If there's one thing <em>Point of Inquiry </em>is concerned about, it's ensuring a rational, sensible conversation in politics, in public life. And you simply can't have such a conversation if the culture is awash in political, and politicized, misinformation.</p>
<p>What do we mean by "misinformation"? The denial of global warming. Claims about "death panels." Assertions that the President of the United States wasn't actually born here.</p>
<p>One thing all these falsehoods have in common is that if you watch Fox News, you're more likely to believe them. Fox increases your risk, so to speak, of believing factually wrong things to support a political agenda. With other networks, this "Fox effect" just isn't there.</p>
<p>How did it get this way? How did one leading network become a fount of misinformation?</p>
<p>For that, we turn to the most dedicated Fox monitors of them all—Media Matters. They've got a new book out on Fox, and I've invited their Executive Vice President, Ari Rabin-Havt, on to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong> Ari Rabin-Havt</strong> is Executive Vice President at Media Matters. He is co-author, with David Brock, of <em>The Fox Effect: How Roger Ailes Turned a Network into a Propaganda Machine</em>.</p>]]></description>

<p>One of the costs of being conscious is that, once in a while, we are forced to contemplate the fact that we are mortal. Ironically, a close brush with the grim reaper leaves many people more convinced than ever that our minds are not tethered to our bodies, and therefore can survive physical death. What can these near-death experiences tell us about how well we understand our own consciousness?</p>
<p>To explore this topic, we first talked to anesthesiologist <strong>Gerald Woerlee</strong>, author of <em>Mortal Minds: The Biology of NDEs</em> to get a sense of what makes NDEs so compelling to people looking for evidence of an afterlife. Then, we sought the expertise of <strong>Susan Blackmore</strong>, psychologist and author, whose book <em>Consciousness: An Introduction</em> breaks down the complex theories of consciousness into digestible chunks. Dodging the sandtraps of dualism along the way, we speculate on implications of NDEs for meta-consciousness while keeping the mind strictly within the confines of the body.</p>]]></description>

<p>So who's <em>right</em>, factually, about politics and science? Who speaks truth, and who's just spinning?</p>
<p>It's kind of the million dollar question. If we could actually answer it, we'd have turned political debate itself into a... well, a science.</p>
<p>And is such an answer possible? What does the scientific evidence suggest?</p>
<p>In this episode of <em>Point of Inquiry</em>, Chris Mooney brought back a popular guest from last year, Yale's <strong>Dan Kahan</strong>, to discuss this very question-one that they've been emailing about pretty much continually ever since Kahan appeared on the show.</p>
<p>In the episode, Kahan and Mooney not only review but debate the evidence on whether "motivated" ideological biases are the same on both sides of the political aisle—or alternatively, whether they're actually "asymmetrical."</p>
<p><strong>Dan Kahan</strong> is the Elizabeth K. Dollard Professor of Law and Professor of Psychology at the Yale Law School. He's also the Eli Goldston Visiting Professor at Harvard Law School. His research focuses on "cultural cognition"-how our social and political group affiliations affect our views of what's true in contested areas like global warming and nuclear power-and motivated reasoning. Before then, he served as a law clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall, of the U.S. Supreme Court (1990-91) and to Judge Harry Edwards of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (1989-90).</p>]]></description>

<p>Here's a hint as to why: Krauss's answer to this age-old question isn't God. In fact, as discussed on the program, Krauss has arguably written the book that "kicks God out of physics."</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <em>Point of Inquiry</em> host Chris Mooney attended Science Online, the premiere science blogging conference, in the research triangle area.</p>
<p>There were many science aficionados, communicators, and wonks present, but Chris found himself hanging out a lot with Brian Malow—aka, <a href="http://www.sciencecomedian.com/" target="_blank">the Science Comedian</a>.</p>
<p>And get this—Malow lived up to his name. He was pretty funny. Chris decided he had to get him on air.</p>

<p>Eugenie Scott is no stranger to <em>Point of Inquiry</em>, or to the secular community. Her endless travails to defend the teaching of evolution have won her immense respect.</p>
<p>And that's why, when Scott and her National Center for Science Education take on a new initiative, everybody listens. So for this <em>Point of Inquiry</em> episode, we invited Eugenie to break some news about why she is venturing into a very new and very challenging area—defending the teaching of accurate climate change science in schools from a mounting ideological assault—and how you can help her out.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Karen Stollznow</p>
<p>Dr. Stuart Robbins is a postdoctoral researcher in astronomy at the University of Colorado, Boulder. His work focuses on planetary geophysics, and he’s currently researching craters on Mars, and on the moon. Stuart received his PhD in Astrophysics through the Geophysics program from the University of Colorado at Boulder.</p>
<p>Stuart has a special interest in astronomy education, especially correcting myths and misconceptions about astronomy. To that end, he has a blog entitled <a href="http://pseudoastro.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Exposing PseudoAstronomy</a>, and a <a href="http://podcast.sjrdesign.net/" target="_blank">podcast</a> by the same name. Since 2012 is supposed to be our last year on earth, again, Stuart dispels some claims about the Mayan Prophecy.</p>
<p>In this interview with Karen Stollznow, Stuart provides a rundown on the Mayan Long Calendar, and discusses the different calculations and end dates. He talks about the link, or lack thereof, between the calendar and the end of the world. Stuart talks about the many ways in which the world is supposed to end in 2012, via planetary lineups, galactic alignments, pole shifts, crustal displacement, solar flares, or the mysterious Planet X.</p>
<p>Stuart delves into metaphysical claims that 2012 isn’t the catastrophic end of the world, but represents some kind of beginning, or new age of transformation. Finally he tells us, when December 21, 2012 has come and gone, when is the next Armageddon?</p>]]></description>

<p>How do you successfully debunk misinformation?</p>
<p>The question is a deceptively simple one—which is precisely the problem.</p>
<p>Debunking is easy—just refute false claims, and provide corrective information.</p>
<p>Debunking <em>successfully </em>is something else again-you have to change minds, and make the corrective information stick. And how does that work?</p>
<p>Well, as it turns out, we actually don't know very much about the process. But what we do know was recently compiled into a brilliant short document, the <em>Debunking Handbook</em>, available free for download from the website Skeptical Science.</p>
<p>Point of Inquiry recently caught up with one of its authors, John Cook, in San Francisco at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union.</p>
<p>John Cook is the Climate Communication Fellow for the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland in Australia. He studied physics, and maintains the popular global warming website "Skeptical Science," which refutes misinformation by explaining, in user friendly fashion, the findings of the peer reviewed literature.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>Over the last decade, there have been many calls in the secular community for increased criticism of religion, and increased activism to help loosen its grip on the public.</p>
<p>But what if the human brain itself is aligned against that endeavor?</p>
<p>That's the argument made by cognitive scientist Robert McCauley in his new book, <em>Why Religion is Natural and Science is Not</em>.</p>
<p>In it, he lays out a cognitive theory about why our minds, from a very early state of development, seem predisposed toward religious belief—and not predisposed towards the difficult explanations and understandings that science offers.</p>
<p>If McCauley is right, spreading secularism and critical thinking may always be a difficult battle—although one no less worthy of undertaking.</p>
<p>Dr. McCauley is University Professor and Director of the Center for Mind, Brain, and Culture at Emory University. He is also the author of <em>Rethinking Religion</em> and <em>Bringing Ritual to Mind</em>.</p>]]></description>

<p>Scott Gavura is a registered pharmacist in Ontario with a personal and professional interest in improving the way we use medication. Scott started the <a href="http://sciencebasedpharmacy.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Science-Based Pharmacy</a> blog in 2009 to scrutinize pharmacy practices, and to begin a discussion within the industry about its obligations as a health profession.</p>
<p>Scott has a Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy and a Masters of Business Administration degree from the University of Toronto, and has completed an Accredited Canadian Hospital Pharmacy Residency Program. His professional background includes pharmacy work in community, hospital and government settings.

<p>In this interview with host Karen Stollznow, Scott talks about the changing scene of the pharmaceutical industry. They discuss the pseudoscientific products and services to be found in compounding pharmacies, integrative pharmacies, and general pharmacies. Scott explains his position on taking supplements, fortified foods and placebo prescriptions, and answers a few practical questions about generic drugs vs. brand name drugs, expiry dates, and storing and disposing of medication. Scott speaks about the new applications of old drugs, and answers the all-time question: How does a pharmacist learn to read a doctor's handwriting?</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>Our guest this week is Jonathan Weiler, a political scientist and director of global studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.</p>
<p>Weiler is co-author, with Marc Hetherington of Vanderbilt, of the book <em>Authoritarianism and Polarization in American Politics</em>.</p>
<p>In it, they describes this strange and troubling creature called an authoritarian—usually conservative, usually a religious fundamentalist, and very closed minded.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Robert Price</p>
<p>Ebenezer Scrooge once called Christmas "a false and commercial holiday." Is it? Should Humanists refuse to observe it? Should they wage war on it? Should they celebrate "Sanka" versions of it like Solstice and "HumanLight"? Christians complain that the holiday has become secularized—so should Secular Humanists just say "Thanks!" and enjoy listening to "Let It Snow" and "Winter Wonderland"? As always, Tom Flynn brings new and well-informed perspectives to a difficult issue!</p>
<p>Tom Flynn is the Executive Director of the Council for Secular Humanism and the editor of <em>Free Inquiry</em> magazine. He is the author of the science-fiction novels <em>Galactic Rapture</em> and <em>Nothing Sacred</em>, which involve the lore of Mormonism, on which Tom is an authority. He is also a historian of the Freethought movement and a frequent speaker in humanist circles. You would be well advised to mortgage your home and purchase a copy of <em>The New Encyclopedia of Unbelief</em>, which Tom edited. Perhaps his most notorious book, though, is <em>The Trouble with Christmas</em>, which has a lot to do with this episode.</p>]]></description>

<p>Dr. Seth Shostak is the Senior Astronomer at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI). Seth is the author of <em>Confessions of an Alien Hunter: A Scientist's Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence</em>, and is well known as one of the hosts of the popular radio show <em>Big Picture Science</em>. (Formerly known as <em>Are We Alone?</em>)</p>
<p>Seth is a science communicator who performs public outreach; especially to young people, about science in general, and astrobiology in particular. He has published hundreds of popular articles on science, and gives dozens of talks annually. He is also a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.</p>
<p>In this <em>Point of Inquiry</em> interview with host Karen Stollznow, Seth discusses the "three-pronged effort" to find extraterrestrial life. He believes that while no one can be certain, there is a chance of success within one or two decades, and he explains how this prediction can be made. Seth then explains why, if we find that life, we would need to tread carefully.</p>
<p>Seth talks about SETI's past and present projects, critics and the Fermi paradox, and whether the organization spends more time searching for funding than ETs. He discusses current findings in astronomy, and how these discoveries may affect the SETI search. Lastly, Seth talks about outreach and education, and tells us exactly what the public knows (and doesn't know) about astronomy.</p>]]></description>

<p>This October-on Halloween weekend-the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry is holding a conference: <a href="http://www.csiconference.org/" target="_blank">CSICon</a>. It's the latest in a line of CSI skeptics' conferences going back to what is likely the first skeptics' conference ever held, a CSICOP (CSI) conference back in 1983.</p>
<p>This episode of <em>Point of Inquiry</em> revolves around CSICon. It features interviews with Barry Karr, Jim Underdown, and Debbie Goddard.</p>
<p><strong>Barry Karr</strong> is the Executive Director of CSI and <em>Skeptical Inquirer</em> magazine. He was at that first conference in 1983 and he's the driving force behind upcoming CSICon. Barry talks about how trends in skepticism have changed throughout the years, what skeptics talked (and worried) about then, what they focus on now, and where they should go from here.</p>
<p><strong>Jim Underdown</strong> is Executive Director of CFI LA, Chair and Founder of the Independent Investigations Group (IIG), and lead singer and songwriter for The Heathens, an "all-star, all-atheist, all-skeptic, band from Los Angeles." Jim explains how the band got started, what their music is all about, and where we can hear them play. He also talks about the IIG, their work, and what they're planning to do at CSICon.</p>
<p><strong>Debbie Goddard</strong> is Coordinator of the CFI On Campus program and Director of African Americans for Humanism—and more importantly she does the date stamp at the beginning of <em>Point of Inquiry</em> episodes. Debbie is speaking on a panel at CSICon called "Grassroots Outreach and Activism". She talks about skeptical outreach and activism—and why it's important, diversity in the skeptical movement, and how you can get involved.</p>]]></description>

She talks about skeptical outreach and activism—and why it's important, diversity in the skeptical movement, and how you can get involved.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Karen Stollznow</p>
<p>Indre Viskontas is a neuroscientist, a soprano, and a skeptic. She is a host of the television show <em>The Miracle Detectives</em> that recently aired on the Oprah Winfrey Network. Indre appeared as the scientific investigator pitted against "believer" Randall Sullivan, author of the book <em>The Miracle Detective</em>. The show investigates claims of "miracles"; from supposedly miraculous dirt believed to cure cancer, through to a beam of light in a hospital alleged to be an angel of mercy.</p>
<p>In this interview with host Karen Stollznow, Indre talks about her experiences on the show. She tells us which skeptical messages were communicated to the public, and which ended up on the cutting room floor. She discusses how the audience responded to the show; the fact she has influenced viewers in a positive way, but that people are still very reluctant to relinquish their beliefs. Indre also ponders the dangers of these beliefs.</p>
<p>Lastly, Indre explains how to convince people to think more critically, and how to capture a large audience without sacrificing skeptical principles.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>This coming October, in Kabul, Afghanistan—on a date, and in a location, that remain undisclosed—there will be a rock concert that's billed as the world's "<a href="http://soundcentralfestival.com/" target="_blank">first stealth music festival</a>."</p>
<p>It will feature rock, heavy metal, and funk from Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, and Iran.</p>
<p>Why "stealth"? In some of these countries, music is equivalent to political and religious subversion. Which is precisely why those of us who care about liberal democracy and secularism need to also care, deeply indeed, about music—and ensuring it gets out.</p>
<p>This week, Point of Inquiry spoke to an organizer of the Kabul event, as well as a longtime freethinker, and musician—Austin Dacey. He's head of the <a href="http://www.impossiblemusic.org/" target="_blank">Impossible Music Sessions</a>, which describes itself as featuring "the artists who cannot appear and the music that is banned in their homelands."</p>
<p>The purpose of the organization is to bring together musicians, producers, and audiences across cultures, space, and genres to share musical expression-and, enlarge its political potential.</p>
<p>Austin also happens to be a philosopher, author, and human rights activist. His books include <em>The Secular Conscience</em> and, due out next year, <em>The Future of Blasphemy</em>.</p>]]></description>

<p>Often successful Christian activists simply cannot allow themselves to entertain doubts as to the worthiness of their enterprise, but Lee had a dangerous yearning for critical thought. It caused him to look back on all he had said and done and to wonder if perhaps he had been kidding himself and others. He left it all behind and turned instead to a new gospel, that of intellectual honesty and responsibility for one's own beliefs.</p>

<p>In less than two weeks, the ten year anniversary of the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil—9/11—will be upon us.</p>
<p>In the past decade, there has been much debate and discussion about the root causes of terrorism and violent extremism. There has also been considerable scientific study of the matter.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <em>Point of Inquiry</em> recently caught up with the anthropologist Scott Atran, a world leader in this research. Atran has met with terrorists face to face.

<p>There's probably nobody better if you want to talk about terrorism, what motivates it, and how these extremes fit within the broad tapestry of human nature.</p>
<p>Scott Atran is a research director in anthropology at the French National Center for Scientific Research, and holds a variety of appointments at other academic institutions. He's also the author of several books including <em>In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion</em> and <em>Talking to the Enemy: Faith, Brotherhood, and the (Un)Making of Terrorists</em>.

<p>Host Robert M. Price felt uncannily as if he were talking to himself when he interviewed Dan Barker, the two share so much in common. But then their story is not so unusual, come to think of it. The same sort of thing seems to be happening to more and more Evangelicals these days! </p>
<p>For you see, Dan used to be an Evangelical preacher and a Christian musician. One day he started having second thoughts about the path he once imagined God had chosen for him. Whoever had urged him to pursue the ministry had no idea he was creating a Frankenstein monster—at lease from the fundamentalst viewpoint, for Dan has become a frequent and effective debater against Christian opponents.</p>
<p>With his wife Annie-Laurie Gaylor, Dan is one of the executives of The Freedom from Religion Foundation. His books include <em>Losing Faith in Faith: From Preacher to Atheist</em>, <em>The Good Atheist: Living a Purpose-Filled Life Without God</em>, and <em>Godless: How an Evangelical Preacher Became One of America's Leading Atheists</em>.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>Why are human beings simultaneously capable of reasoning, and yet so bad at it? Why do we have such faulty mechanisms as the "confirmation bias" embedded in our brains, and yet at the same time, find ourselves capable of brilliant rhetoric and complex mathematical calculations?</p>
<p>According to Hugo Mercier, we've been reasoning about reason all wrong. Reasoning is very good at what it probably <em>evolved </em>to let us do—argue in favor of what we believe and try to convince others that we're right.</p>
<p>In a recent and much discussed paper in the journal <em>Behavioral and Brain Research</em>, Mercier and his colleague Dan Sperber proposed what they call an "argumentative theory of reason." "A wide range of evidence in the psychology of reasoning and decision making can be reinterpreted and better explained in the light of this hypothesis," they write.</p>
<p>Given the discussion this proposal has prompted, <em>Point of Inquiry</em> wanted to hear from Mercier to get more elaboration on his ideas.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>My guest this week is Donald Prothero, Professor of Geology at Occidental College, and Lecturer in Geobiology at the California Institute of Technology. Don is a distinguished academic; a Fellow of the Geological Society of America and the Paleontological Society, he has received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p>Don contributes to the <em>SkepticBlog </em>and he has been featured on several television documentaries, including episodes of <em>Prehistoric Monsters Revealed</em> and <em>Walking with Prehistoric Beasts</em>. He has edited and written numerous scientific papers, textbooks and books, including <em>Evolution of the Earth</em>, <em>Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters</em>, and his most recent title, <em>Catastrophes!: Earthquakes, Tsunamis, Tornadoes, and Other Earth-Shattering Disasters</em>.</p>
<p>In this episode of <em>Point of Inquiry</em>, Karen Stollznow speaks with Don about one of his pet interests, cryptozoology and the psychology of cryptozoologists. He answers the questions, why do people believe in monsters and what do they believe? Is cryptozoology all pseudoscience or are any scientists involved in the field? What would allow cryptozoology to be taken seriously as a true science?</p>
<p>They discuss the language, culture and characters of the "cryptozoological subculture". Lastly, Don reveals why creationists are now exploring cryptozoology, and the reasons why we shouldn't dismiss the study as an "innocent hobby".</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>When it comes to the U.S. political right, it often appears that the opposition to science-and reason in general-is everywhere. From climate change denial to anti-evolutionism; from debt ceiling denial to, that's right, <a href="http://www.desmogblog.com/light-bulb-madness-new-case-study-right-wing-misinformation" target="_blank">incandescent light bulb availability denial</a>; conservatives today have plenty to answer for.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some conservatives know it. And given how much he has blasted the "Republican War on Science" in the past, on this show Chris Mooney wanted to hear their take.</p>
<p>So he invited on David Frum. Frum is the editor of the group blog <a href="http://www.frumforum.com/" target="_blank">Frum Forum</a>, a former speechwriter for the George W. Bush White House, and a widely published author, most recently of <em>Comeback: Conservatism that Can Win Again</em>. In recent years, Frum has become a leading critic of today's GOP and its allegiance with <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/03/06/why-rush-is-wrong.html" target="_blank">the likes of Rush Limbaugh</a> and Fox News.</p>
<p>Joining Frum is Kenneth Silber, a frequent contributor to Frum Forum. Silber is a science writer based in New Jersey who contributes to <em>Research Magazine</em>, <em>Scientific American</em>, and other outlets. <a href="http://www.frumforum.com/how-i-joined-the-vast-rino-conspiracy" target="_blank">He calls himself</a> a "center-right dissenter, a deviationist apostle of the Frumian Heresy" and these days, a RINO (Republican in Name Only).</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Robert Price</p>
<p>A couple of student hecklers once reproved Marlowe's Dr. Faustus: "Faustus! Plumb the depths of that which you profess!" Many evangelical Christians have buckled down to study apologetics or biblical studies in just that spirit—and wound up not professing any more! Their stories are often eerily similar yet always fascinating!</p>
<p>And such a delver was Jaco Gericke. First he read the "safe" stuff, then the books they warned him not to read, and then everything else! Today Dr. Gericke is on the faculty of Humanities at North-West University in South Africa. He holds the Doctor of Letters degree in Semitic Languages and a Ph.D. in Old Testament with a specialization in Philosophy of Religion.</p>
<p>He is the author of dozens of published papers and conference presentations. One of his essays, "Can God Exist if Yahweh Doesn't?" appears in the new John W. Loftus anthology, <em>The End of Christianity</em> from Prometheus Books. His quest is strikingly similar to that of <em>Point of Inquiry</em> host Robert M. Price, who interviews him here.

<p>Our guest this week is Rebecca Watson, the founder of the <a href="http://www.skepchick.org" target="_blank">Skepchick</a> blog. Recently, she's been at the center of an explosive controversy over the relationship between feminism and the skeptic/atheist movement.</p>
<p>It all started when Watson made a relatively casual remark in a video to her followers. She was discussing her travels and a talk she'd given in Ireland about sexism in the atheist/skeptic community. Overall, Watson said, the response to her remarks had been great—but then she added something else. After the talk, she said, she'd received an advance from a man in an elevator—a man who apparently didn't get the message.</p>
<p>"Guys, don't do that," said Watson. "I was a single woman in a foreign country at 4 am in a hotel elevator with you. Just you. Don't invite me back to your hotel room right after I finish talking about how it creeps me out and makes me uncomfortable when men sexualize me in that manner."</p>
<p>In one way or another—and with many other debate participants involved-this story led to thousands upon thousands of blog comments, and an outpouring of support-and criticism. So <em>Point of Inquiry</em> asked Watson to address the controversy, and to talk more generally about atheism and feminism.</p>

<p>Richard Wiseman is Professor of the Public Understanding of Psychology at the University of Hertfordshire in England.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>It's not often that Hollywood takes up the subject of atheism directly—much less sympathetically.</p>
<p>Even rarer is finding this in a film starring major names like Liv Tyler and Terence Howard.</p>
<p>But that's what Matthew Chapman has achieved in <em>The Ledge—</em>which also stars Patrick Wilson and Charlie Hunnan.</p>
<p>Besides being a screenwriter and author, Chapman himself is an atheist, freethinker, science advocate, and great-great grandson of Charles Darwin.</p>
<p>Without giving away the plot of <em>The Ledge—</em>which opens on July 8 in New York and Los Angeles—suffice it to say that it is a gutsy defense of freethinking and unbelief, framed as a star-studded romantic thriller. And perhaps even more than any work of nonfiction, it may have a unique potential to drive a national conversation about atheism.</p>
<p>So recently, Chris Mooney caught up with Matthew Chapman for lunch in New York City to interview him about the film, what inspired it, and what he hopes its impact will be.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>Recently, we've seen a spate of news stories—and news incidents—involving conservative politicians and activists getting details wrong about American history.</p>
<p>There was, most infamously, Sarah Palin <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS4C7bvHv2w" target="_blank">saying that Paul Revere</a>, on his famous midnight ride, rang bells and "warned the British."</p>
<p>There was Michele Bachman, <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/01/bachmann-america-was-founded-on-diversity-video.php" target="_blank">claiming that the founding fathers</a> "worked tirelessly until slavery was no more in the United States." Actually, the constitution explicitly treated slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of apportioning representatives to different states.</p>
<p>And then was David Barton, conservatives' go-to guy on history, <a href="http://www.religiondispatches.org/dispatches/laurilebo/4736/david_barton:_creationist_founding_fathers_settled_debate_over_evolution/?comments=view&cID=18746&pID=18744" target="_blank">suggesting that Tom Paine</a> was, basically, a supporter of creationism.</p>
<p>To try to figure out what's going on lately with conservatives and history, we turn to a historian, Rick Perlstein. Perlstein is the author of several books including <em>Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of American Consensus</em>, and <em>Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America</em>. He's also a regular contributor to a variety of publications including <em>The American Prospect</em> and <em>Mother Jones</em>.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Karen Stollznow</p>
<p>This week’s guest is Jean Mercer, a Developmental Psychologist and Professor Emerita at Richard Stockton College. She is the author of the new book <em>Child Development: Myths and Misunderstandings</em>.</p>
<p>Jean writes the blog "Child Myths", and along with Penn Jillette and Richard Dawkins, she is a co-author of <em>Parenting Beyond Belief: On Raising Ethical, Caring Kids Without Religion</em>. Jean is also a contributor and Consulting Editor to the Center for Inquiry’s journal, the <em>Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice</em>.</p>
<p>In this interview with Karen Stollznow, Jean talks about the developing field of developmental psychology. Jean jokes that "studying child development isn’t rocket science…it’s a lot more complicated than that!" This is an area that is fraught with myths, mistakes and misconceptions; Jean explains how these develop and the often serious repercussions.</p>
<p>Jean discusses the importance of critical thinking about child development. Pseudoscientific therapies often have the semblance of science, so what information can we trust? Jean talks about the emphasis on evidence-based practice in developmental psychology, and why we have to think critically about that too.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>Our guest this week is Michael Shermer, the publisher of <em>Skeptic </em>magazine and head of the Skeptics Society, and a longtime commentator on issues relating to science, critical thinking, and the paranormal.</p>
<p>Chris asked Michael on to discuss his new book, which is entitled <em>The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies, How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforce Them As Truths</em>.</p>
<p>Clearly, much of what Shermer has to say here will be of great relevance to skeptics and freethinkers—and along the way, Shermer also discusses his views on global warming (real, but not such a big deal) and how to promote evolution in a religious America.</p>
<p>In addition to publishing <em>Skeptic</em>, Michael Shermer is  a monthly columnist for <em>Scientific American</em>, the host of the Skeptics Distinguished Science Lecture Series at Caltech, and Adjunct Professor at Claremont Graduate University. His other books include <em>Why People Believe in Weird Things</em> and <em>Why Darwin Matters</em>.</p>]]></description>

<p>Do you often wish you lived in the far future? Or on a different planet? Do your friends and family think you belong there, too?</p>
<p>Cheer up! This may not be just because you're a science fiction nerd! It may be because you espouse a worldview that is in the distinct minority in our time and place—Secular Humanism! It is a vision of a better future. And that is no doubt why many of us feel such an affinity for SF, and of course for Gene Roddenberry's <em>Star Trek</em>. It is a vision of a future when scientific Humanism has prevailed.</p>
<p>Join Robert Price, himself a notorious Sci-Fi/Fantasy geek, as he interviews the far more respectable Scott Lohman, a lifelong Trekker and a prominent leader and broadcaster for Humanists of Minnesota.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Special Guest Host: Ronald A. Lindsay</p>
<p>In this special episode, Chris Mooney changes places and becomes the interviewee—and then finds himself facing some probing questions from CFI President and CEO Ronald A. Lindsay. This frank interview is all substance and no fluff as Mooney is asked to defend accommodationism and his Templeton Foundation fellowship. The tough questions elicit vigorous replies as Mooney restates his belief that some of the New Atheists are adopting the wrong tactics in criticizing religion.</p>
<p>In the second part of the interview, Mooney discusses his recent work on the psychology of belief in general, emphasizing how our commitments and our values shape our reasoning and our processing of information.</p>
<p>Ronald A. Lindsay is a bioethicist, lawyer, and President and CEO of the Center for Inquiry. For many years he practiced law in Washington, DC, and was an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and American University, where he taught jurisprudence and philosophy courses.</p>
<p>As well as a usual host of <em>Point of Inquiry</em>, Chris Mooney is a science and political journalist and commentator and the author of three books, including the New York Times bestselling <em>The Republican War on Science</em> and <em>Unscientific America: How Scientific Illiteracy Threatens Our Future</em>, co-authored by Sheril Kirshenbaum. They also write "The Intersection" blog together for Discover blogs.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This episode was recorded on board the <a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/cruise2011" target="_blank">2011 CFI Greek Islands Cruise</a> on which Mooney was a speaker.</p>]]></description>

<p>Robert "Bo" Bennett wears many hats (author, motivational speaker, black belt Karate master, businessman, etc.) but manages not to have a swelled head to accommodate them! His latest book is called <em>The Concept: Introduction to Christian Nontheism</em>, an accessible and engaging presentation of the case for maintaining one's Christian identity once one has outgrown belief in biblical inspiration, miracles, even God. True, if anyone else in your church found out, they might kick you out, but you wouldn't have a guilty conscience! How to manage this? Is it a mere mind-game? Why bother? What makes Christianity still attractive once the beliefs are gone? This is one interview certain to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comfortable!</p>]]></description>

<p>Our guest this week is Josh Rosenau, the Programs and Policy Director of the National Center for Science Education (NCSE), and writer of the blog <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/" target="_blank">"Thoughts from Kansas"</a> at ScienceBlogs.</p>
<p>Josh has pursued a doctoral candidate at the University of Kansas, studying the ways ecological competition shapes the ecological niche and geographical ranges of species. In his role at the NCSE, he works with grassroots groups, testifies before school boards, meets with legislators, works with scientists to be more effective communicators and the public to increase science literacy globally.</p>
<p>In this interview with Karen Stollznow, Josh presents the "Three Pillars of Creationism", the beliefs and claims of creationists. He describes their rhetoric and propaganda, and the setbacks they cause for science, from legal cases to creationist theme parks.</p>
<p>Josh also talks about some recent successes for science. The NCSE works tirelessly to battle creationists and improve the public understanding of evolution. But this is an organization that aims to "go out of business", and where the staff members ultimately aim to be out of their jobs.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>When the devastating earthquake and tsunami struck Japan last month, it left behind not only mass destruction, but also a nuclear crisis that was covered 24-7 by the international media. </p>
<p>Since then, we've been embroiled in a huge debate about nuclear policy—should there be a "Nuclear Renaissance" in the United States, or should we put it on hold?</p>
<p>A central issue underlying all this is the scientific question of risk. How dangerous is radiation, anyway? Do we overreact to reactors? </p>
<p>To tackle that question, we turned to two different guests. One is one of the world's foremost experts on radiation exposure and its health consequences; the other is a journalist who's done a new book about why we often misperceive risk, to our own detriment.</p>
<p>David Brenner is the director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University. His research focuses on understanding the effects of radiation, at both high and low doses, on living systems, and he has published more than 200 papers in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Dr. Brenner was the recipient of the 1991 Radiation Research Society Annual Research Award, and the 1992 National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements Award for Radiation Protection in Medicine. </p>
<p>David Ropeik is an author, consultant, and speaker on risk communication and risk perception, and an instructor in the Harvard University School of Education, Environmental Management program. He's the author of the 2010 book <em>How Risky is it Really? Why Our Fears Don't Always Match the Facts</em>.</p>]]></description>

<p>My guest this week is Cheryl Russell, a recognized authority on statistics and demographics.</p>
<p>Cheryl is the editorial director of New Strategist Publications and the former editor-in-chief of American Demographics magazine. She is the author of the "Demo Memo" blog and the books <em>The Master Trend</em>, <em>100 Predictions for the Baby Boom</em> and<em> Bet You Didn't Know: Hundreds of Intriguing Facts about Living in the USA</em>.</p>
<p>In this interview with Karen Stollznow, Cheryl reveals that demographic information challenges deeply embedded beliefs about society and explains why there is such a gap between belief and reality. She shows that statistics and demography are not so dull, but instead they afford us a fascinating glimpse into society.</p>
<p>Cheryl explains that typically, the more economically developed the country, the lower the religiosity. Paradoxically, the United States is one of the world's most religious countries. Cheryl discusses some statistics about belief. What percentage of Americans believe in god without a doubt? Do Americans think it is necessary to believe in God to be moral? How many people believe in religious miracles? How many believe in evolution? How reliable are these statistics anyway?</p>]]></description>

Paradoxically, the United States is one of the world's most religious countries. Cheryl discusses some statistics about belief. What percentage of Americans believe in god without a doubt? Do Americans think it is necessary to believe in God to be moral? How many people believe in religious miracles? How many believe in evolution? How reliable are these statistics anyway?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>Recently, it has come to light that many scientists—scientists who don't believe in God--nevertheless claim to be "spiritual but not religious." Some in the secular movement have responded favorably to this new trend-one unfolding against the backdrop of an increasingly secular America, and a millennial generation that is also discarding traditional religion while extolling spiritual meaning.</p>
<p>Yet others are sharply opposed, calling secular "spirituality" little more than a semantic gambit, a misappropriation of misleading, faith-infused language.</p>
<p>In this week's show, we present two different takes on whether we should embrace, or discard, the concept of godless spirituality.</p>
<p>Our first guest, Adam Frank, is a nonbeliever with a deep respect for the domains of human spiritual endeavor who represents the pro-spirituality view. Frank is an assistant professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester, where he studies the formation and evolution of stars. He's also a freelance writer for Discover and Astronomy magazines, a blogger at NPR's 13.7, and author of the book <em>The Constant Fire: Beyond the Science vs. Religion Debate</em>.</p>
<p>Our second guest, Tom Flynn, is a non-believer represents the anti-spirituality view. He's the executive director of the Council for Secular Humanism, editor of <em>Free Inquiry</em> magazine, director of Inquiry Media Productions, and director of the Robert G. Ingersoll Birthplace Museum, among many other accomplishments. He has written numerous books, both fictional and non fictional, including 1993's famed (and in-famed) <em>The Trouble with Christmas</em>.</p>]]></description>

<p>One of the most effective (not to mention hilarious) speakers for atheism and secular humanism today is Frank Zindler, author, linguist, translator, Bible scholar, and scientist—truly a Renaissance Man.</p>
<p>He is an advocate as well for the much-despised but increasingly hard to ignore Christ Myth hypothesis, which he has ably defended in books such as <em>The Jesus the Jews Never Knew</em> and articles like "Where Jesus Never Walked."</p>
<p>He was acting President of American Atheists in 2008 and is editor of both <em>The American Atheist Magazine</em> and <em>American Atheist Press</em>. Frank has also been on the ground floor of The Jesus Project and the Secular Criticism of the Bible group of the Society of Biblical Literature. Though a veteran in the rationalist field, Frank Zindler always manages to supply new and unique insights even on the most familiar questions.</p>
<p>He has debated William Lane Craig and many others. Come and see if he'll be just as tough on Point of Inquiry host Robert M. Price!</p>]]></description>

<p>Our guest this week needs little introduction—he may be our most famous public communicator of science.</p>
<p>He's Neil DeGrasse Tyson, renowned American astrophysicist, director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History, and the host of PBS's <em>NOVA ScienceNow</em>, which just completed a new six part season.</p>

<p>Why do Americans claim to love science, but then selectively reject its findings when they're inconvenient? And why do some cultural groups reject certain types of scientific findings (about, say, harm to the environment), whereas others reject others?</p>
<p>Yale law professor Dan Kahan is doing some of the most cutting edge work right now when it comes to figuring this out. Kahan is trying to resolve what he has called the "American Culture War of Fact," by determining how it is that our core values-whether we are "individualists" or "communitarians," "hierarchs" or "egalitarians"—can sometimes interfere with our perceptions of reality. </p>
<p>Most intriguingly—or, if you prefer, disturbingly—Kahan has found that deep-seated values even determine who we consider to be a scientific expert in the first place.</p>
<p>His results have very large implications for how to depolarize an array of scientific issues-and how to communicate about controversial science in general.</p>
<p>Dan Kahan is the Elizabeth K. Dollard Professor of Law at Yale Law School. In addition to risk perception, his areas of research include criminal law and evidence. He has served as a law clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall of the U.S. Supreme Court (1990-91) and to Judge Harry Edwards of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C.

<p>The nineties witnessed an outbreak of "Satanic Panic," with psychologists dredging up false memories of "Satanic ritual abuse" which landed innocent parents in jail and banked the fires of hysteria.

<p>Actual Satanism seems to be much more innocent, despite a name which invites negative publicity. In this respect Satanism is not unlike atheism. A "dirty word," it seeks to be a positive force. But how can that be if Satanists worship the devil? The Church of Satan, founded in 1966 by Anton LaVey, was a hedonistic and theatrical form of religious humanism, a cult of campy schtick. But from it emerged, in 1975, the Temple of Set, founded by Michael Aquino. This new sect describes itself as Neo-Platonic and reveres Set, an ancient deity understood as a force of will, challenge, and self-development. This religion defies most stereotypes, and thus ought to be of special interest to rationalists, skeptics, and humanists who are weary of debating standard-brand Christian theism.</p>
<p>Don Webb, weird fiction author and High Priest of the Temple of Set, is our guest this week. Join host Robert Price as he interrogates this remarkable figure. How do you play Devil's Advocate with a guy who has been an active practitioner of the Left Handed Path of magic for three decades? Some of Don's fiction is available in the collection <em>When They Came</em>. Nonfiction books include <em>Seven Faces of Darkness</em> and <em>Uncle Setnakt's Essential Guide to the Left Hand Path</em>.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>Our guest this week is Arthur Caplan, sometimes called the country's "most quoted bioethicist" and director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania. In this wide ranging episode, Caplan discusses not only the latest issues and problems in his field, but also how those issues have changed over time.</p>
<p>Fresh from the ideological fights of the Bush administration-over culture war issues like stem cells, cloning, and Terri Schiavo-bioethicists like Caplan are now more focused on practical matters like access to healthcare. And so is the country as a whole.</p>
<p>However, the religious right remains active-encouraging pharmacists to claim a right of "conscience" and refuse to give patients the "morning after pill." Meanwhile, as an excuse to restrict abortion, some are now also making the dubious assertion that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks of gestation. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p> <p>Our guest this week is Arthur Caplan, sometimes called the country's "most quoted bioethicist" and director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania. In this wide ranging episode, Caplan discusses not only the latest issues and problems in his field, but also how those issues have changed over time.</p> <p>Fresh from the ideological fights of the Bush administration-over culture war issues like stem cells, cloning, and Terri Schiavo-bioethicists like Caplan are now more focused on practical matters like access to healthcare. And so is the country as a whole.</p> <p>However, the religious right remains active-encouraging pharmacists to claim a right of "conscience" and refuse to give patients the "morning after pill." Meanwhile, as an excuse to restrict abortion, some are now also making the dubious assertion that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks of gestation. </p> <p>So in this interview, Caplan surveys the leading problems in bioethics today-and those we'll be facing in the very near future. </p> <p>Arthur Caplan is the Emmanuel and Robert Hart Director of the Center for Bioethics, and the Sydney D Caplan Professor of Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>Recently the <em>British Medical Journal</em> dealt yet another blow to 1998 scientific study that first terrified the public about the possibility that vaccines might cause autism. The paper, the <em>Journal</em> alleged, was nothing less than "fraudulent." (<a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full">http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full</a>)</p>
<p>Amazingly, however, no one expects anti-vaccine advocates to retract, change their minds, or cease their activities. Which raises the question: How did they grow so strongly and doggedly convinced to begin with? </p>
<p>That's where Seth Mnookin's new book <em>The Panic Virus: A True Story of Medicine, Science, and Fear</em> comes in. It tells the page turning story behind the thoroughly refuted-but still devoutly believed—claim of  a link between vaccines and autism. The book explores not only the science, but also the parents involved, the autism advocacy and support community, and the crucial role of the media, the Internet, and celebrities like Jenny McCarthy in spreading misinformation about vaccines. </p>
<p>Seth Mnookin is a contributing editor at <em>Vanity Fair</em>, and was previously a senior writer at Newsweek. He's the author of two previous books: <em>Hard News: The Scandals at the New York Times and Their Meaning for American Media</em> and the bestselling <em>Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top</em>, about the Boston Red Sox. <em>The Panic Virus</em> is his third book.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>By now you've probably heard the finding-the United States is growing less godly. More precisely, more and more Americans in surveys report that they lack a religious identity.</p>
<p>These are the so-called "nones," and they already comprise 15 percent of the total population. But there are estimates that their numbers will continue to grow and could someday even surpass major denominations like Catholicism (currently 24 % of the country). Being a "none" is particularly popular among those aged 18-29.</p>
<p>Barry Kosmin is the nation's leading expert on the "nones," a group that he studies through the ARIS, or American Religious Identification Survey. In this episode of Point of Inquiry, he discusses where America is heading with respect to its religious identity, why this change is occurring, and what the implications will be for secular advocacy in the future.</p>
<p>Barry Kosmin is a sociologist and research professor in the Public Policy & Law Program at Trinity College, and founding director of the Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture. Dr. Kosmin has been a principal investigator of the American Religious Identification Survey series since its inception in 1990 as well as national social surveys in Europe, Africa, and Asia. His publications include <em>One Nation under God: Religion in Contemporary American Society</em> (1993) and <em>Religion in a Free Market</em> (2006).</p>]]></description>

<p>A software architect by trade, Reed is author of the blog "An Illustrative Account", and he writes for the James Randi Educational Foundation's blog <em>Swift</em>.

He speaks about how these Open Events aim to distribute knowledge within the community, and reach people beyond the community.</p>
<p>Must every skeptic contribute to skepticism? Does calling oneself a "skeptic" imply that one is active? Reed addresses these questions, and talks about what he calls the "Long Tail" of skepticism, and how skeptics can move from a more passive role in the movement to become participants.

In it, he asks some of the biggest of questions to "the widest cross-section of humanity possible." Why do we exist? What is our purpose? What is truth? He asked these and many other substantial questions to individuals with a wide range of worldviews—from Richard Dawkins, to 24th generation Chinese Taoist Master Zhang Chengda, to the founder of Ultimate Christian Wrestling, Rob Adonis.</p>
<p>In this wide-ranging conversation with Robert Price, Nygard discusses whether or not it's worthwhile to distinguish between "normal" religions and "weird" fringe belief systems. He talks about some common themes and huge differences in the worldviews he explored, and whether or not he found any of the worldviews to be helpful or genuinely harmful.</p>
<p>He talks about the conflict between science and religion, and even shares his own best guess at the meaning of existence.</p>
<p>Roger Nygard has directed, produced, written, and edited for film and television. He directed and edited <em>Trekkies</em> (1999), <em>Trekkies 2</em> (2004), and <em>Six Days in Roswell</em> (2000), a docu-comedy about UFO enthusiasts.</p>
<p>For television, he has directed and edited episodes of the HBO series, <em>The Mind of the Married Man</em>, edited episodes of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>, and directed episodes of the FOX series <em>The Bernie Mac Show </em>and <em>The Loop</em>, the NBC series <em>The Office</em>, the DisneyXD series <em>Zeke & Luther</em>, and many others.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>Recently at Pomona College in California, three atheists—one of them a <em>Point of Inquiry</em> host—got together to debate the future of the movement.</p>
<p>And some sparks flew.</p>
<p>Topics raised included the rise of the so-called "nones" (those professing "no religion" in surveys), the lack of representation for atheists in the U.S. Congress, and the debate between moderate or "live-and-let-live" atheism as opposed to a louder and more aggressive version.</p>
<p>Despite their disagreement, it was clear that it’s an exciting time for the movement, as atheism  becomes more visible in American life. Where do we go from here?</p>
<p>The students in the packed audience have that in their hands.</p>
<p>Panel participants were:</p>
<p><strong>David Silverman</strong>, president of American Atheists. Mr. Silverman attended Brandeis University and specialized in computer science; he worked as an inventor at Bell Labs for 8 years. He then served at American Atheists as national spokesperson, vice president, and finally president, a post he assumed this year.</p>
<p><strong>Hemant Mehta</strong> writes the "<a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/">Friendly Atheist</a>" blog and serves on the board of directors of the Foundation Beyond Belief and the Secular Student Alliance. He has also appeared on the front page of the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and is author of the book <em>I Sold My Soul on eBay</em>, released in 2007.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Karen Stollznow</p>
<p>This week is a special episode featuring interviews with two guests, James Randi and D.J. Grothe.</p>
<p>James Randi is a world-renowned magician and the modern-day Houdini of skepticism. He is the author of numerous books, including <em>Flim-Flam! Psychics, ESP, Unicorns and Other Delusions</em> and the forthcoming <em>A Magician in the Laboratory</em>. He is the founder and Chairman of the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF). This interview was recorded live at The Amaz!ng Meeting 8 in Las Vegas, 2010.</p>
<p>In this interview with Karen Stollznow, Randi reflects on his life's work. He speaks about his organization and his role as a central figure in skepticism. He also talks about the JREF's One Million Dollar Challenge, claims he'd like to test, and Sylvia Browne's infamous reluctance to be tested, despite accepting the challenge.</p>
<p>More recently, Karen spoke with D.J. Grothe, President of the JREF and Host of the podcast <em>For Good Reason</em>. Grothe is the former Vice President for Outreach at the Center for Inquiry, and of course, the former Host of <em>Point of Inquiry</em>.</p>
<p>Grothe speaks about the JREF’s mission, and the greatest successes and challenges of the organization. He discusses his plans to "put the 'E' into the JREF" by focusing on education, and talks about his tireless work in skeptical outreach and activism.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>For the community of scientists who study the Earth’s climate, these are bewildering times.</p>
<p>They've seen wave upon wave of political attacks. They're getting accustomed to a public that grows more skeptical of their conclusions even as scientists grow more confident in them.</p>
<p>No wonder there’s much frustration out there in the climate science world—and now, a group of researchers have organized to do something about it. Their initiative is called the Climate Science Rapid Response Team, and it pledges to organize dozens of researchers to help set the record straight.</p>
<p>But can scientists really maintain a war room? What would that look like? How far can they go in fighting back against misinformation, without leaving themselves politically exposed?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, Point of Inquiry called up two of the initiative's founders: John Abraham and Scott Mandia.</p>
<p>John Abraham is an associate professor of engineering at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. He has some 80 published papers, conference papers, and patents to his name.</p>
<p>Scott Mandia is a professor of physical sciences at Suffolk County Community College in Selden, New York. He runs the “Global Warming Fact of the Day” group on Facebook, and is known as <a href="http://twitter.com/AGW_Prof">@AGW_Prof</a> on Twitter.</p>]]></description>

<p>How did his studies at Catholic Georgetown University set CFI President and CEO Ronald A. Lindsay on the primrose path to atheism? Does he now count himself a lawyer or a philosopher, neither, or both? <em>Point of Inquiry</em> asks Ron about the basis for ethics for atheists and secularists. Are atheists nihilists, as is often said? Would that necessarily be bad? Host Robert Price and Lindsay carry on a brisk, illuminating discussion of Aquinas, Kant, and Hume, applying their insights to ethics and public policy.</p>
<p>One often hears secularists complaining that religious believers are voting the theological party line of their church, e.g., in the case of abortion. But does it matter where their moral convictions come from? Is it the genetic fallacy for us to say they are trying to "impose their theology on the rest of us"? Ron also comments on the problem with posting the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms. Finally, he provides his privileged perspective on the direction and approach of CFI since the departure of founder Paul Kurtz.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>It’s a longstanding debate in the philosophy of science: Is "demarcation" possible? Can we really draw firm lines between science and pseudoscience?</p>
<p>Massimo Pigliucci thinks so. In his new book <em>Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science from Bunk</em>, Pigliucci attempts to rescue the notion that there are claims we can rule out, and claims we can rule in—a real means of determining what’s science and what isn’t.</p>
<p>Along the way, Pigliucci touches on howlers like creationism and astrology, and borderland areas of research like SETI—and weighs whether science can ever hope to test claims about the supernatural.</p>
<p>Massimo Pigliucci is chair of the philosophy department at CUNY-Lehman College. He was formerly a professor of ecology and evolution at Stony Brook. He’s a prolific blogger and commentator on issues concerning science and skepticism and a prominent battler of creationists and other nonsense peddlers. You can find him online at <a href="http://www.rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com" target="_blank">rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com</a>.</p>]]></description>

<p>Warren Bonett is a skeptic, author and an independent bookseller. Warren wanted to become actively involved in critical thinking without joining an organization or becoming an –ism, so he opened "Embiggen Books". This is a unique store specializing in skeptical and science titles... right in the middle of a New Age township. He has been told that his store has "great feng shui."</p>
<p>In this interview with Karen Stollznow, Warren recommends books for those who are new to skepticism, and suggests titles to introduce children to science and critical thinking.</p>
<p>Warren is also a bookseller who has edited a book. He is editor and contributor to <em>The Australian Book of Atheism</em>. This project includes 32 essays about religion and secularism written by pre-eminent Australian atheist, rationalist, humanist, and skeptic thinkers, including Russell Blackford, Tim Minchin, Graham Oppy, Robyn Williams, and Martin Bridgstock.</p>
<p>Its blurb states that the book "showcases the unique character of Australian atheism." Warren tells us exactly what is unique about atheism in Australia, and discusses the issues that are specific to Australian society.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>On the show this week, <em>Point of Inquiry</em> features one of our most distinguished science writers—Carl Zimmer. He's the author of many acclaimed books, including <em>Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea</em>, and now he’s taken on an experiment: Publishing his next book, <em>Brain Cuttings</em>, as an e-book, digital only.</p>
<p>The book collects Carl’s many writings about the brain—including essays about why we zone out, whether Google is making us stupid, and perhaps most memorable of all, the Singularity folks who think our brains will soon be downloadable. Needless to say, Zimmer isn’t quite so sure.</p>
<p>In a wide ranging conversation, Zimmer also discussed why science’s biggest undiscovered continent is inside our heads—and what our growing understanding of the brain means for the future of religion.</p>
<p>Carl Zimmer has been called "as fine a science essayist as we have" by the <em>New York Times</em> Book Review. He contributes regularly the <em>New York Times</em> science section, as well as numerous other publications, and blogs for <em>Discover</em> magazine’s Discover Blogs site. In addition, he’s the author of seven books, including <em>Microcosm: E. Coli and the New Science of Life</em>, and teaches science and environmental writing at Yale University.</p>]]></description>

<p>Our guest is philosopher and author John Shook, discussing his experiences debating religious believers and whether such debates are a good idea.</p>
<p>Some say no, that such spectacles merely serve believers by making it look like atheists take them more seriously than they deserve. Others say yes, because debates provide a precious opportunity to introduce believers to atheistic arguments they might otherwise never hear.</p>
<p>Price and Shook compare notes about debating superstar apologist William Lane Craig, discuss interesting insights on Presuppositionalism and Postmodernism, and talk about Dr. Shook's new book, <em>The God Debates: A 21st Century Guide for Atheists and Believers (and Everyone in Between)</em>, an introduction to major issues in the philosophy of religion, as well as debate topics old and new.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently at the 30th anniversary conference of the Council for Secular Humanism in Los Angeles, leading science blogger PZ Myers and <em>Point of Inquiry</em> host Chris Mooney appeared together on a panel to discuss the questions, "How should secular humanists respond to science and religion? If we champion science, must we oppose faith? How best to approach flashpoints like evolution education?"</p>
<p>It's a subject about which they are known to... er, differ.</p>
<p>The moderator was Jennifer Michael Hecht, the author of <em>Doubt: A History</em>. The next day, the three reprised their public debate for a special episode of <em>Point of Inquiry</em>, with Hecht sitting in as a guest host in Mooney's stead. </p>
<p>This is the unedited cut of their three way conversation.</p>
<p>PZ Myers is a biologist at the University of Minnesota-Morris who, in addition to his duties as a teacher of biology and especially of development and evolution, likes to spend his spare time poking at the follies of creationists, Christians, crystal-gazers, Muslims, right-wing politicians, apologists for religion, and anyone who doesn't appreciate how much the beauty of reality exceeds that of ignorant myth.</p>
<p>Jennifer Michael Hecht is the author of award-winning books of philosophy, history, and poetry, including: <em>Doubt: A History</em> (HarperCollins, 2003); <em>The End of the Soul: Scientific Modernity, Atheism and Anthropology</em> (Columbia University Press, 2003); and <em>The Happiness Myth</em>, (HarperCollins in 2007). Her work appears in <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>, <em>The New Republic</em>, and <em>The New Yorker</em>. Hecht earned her Ph.D. in History from Columbia University in 1995 and now teaches in the graduate writing program of The New School University.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Karen Stollznow</p>
<p>Steve Spangler is a science educator, inventor, and an Emmy Award winning TV personality. He is the author of <em>Fizz Factor: 50 Amazing Experiments With Soda Pop</em>, <em>Secret Science: 25 Science Experiments Your Teacher Doesn't Know About</em> and his latest title <em>Naked Eggs And Flying Potatoes</em>.</p>
<p>Steve’s inquiry-based learning approaches to science education are highly successful. With his innovative "hands-on" approach to teaching he is the "fun science guy" who shoots potatoes, makes toilet paper fly and mixes batches of slime; but he is best known for his erupting soda geyser experiment.</p>
<p>Behind all of this fun is a very serious mission: to improve science literacy for both children, and adults.</p>
<p>In this episode with Karen Stollznow, Steve tackles the "science is boring" stereotype, and explains how science education can be exciting, accessible and fun. Steve talks about using the Internet for effective science education, citing his famous viral video, the “Mentos and Diet Coke geyser experiment” that has had millions of views and inspired thousands of imitations.</p>
<p>Steve not only teaches students, but he also teaches teachers. He talks about becoming a great science teacher by creating unforgettable learning experiences. With Steve’s interactive methods, science has suddenly gone from "Don’t try this at home!" to "Try this for yourself and see how it works!"</p>
<p>In closing, Steve discusses the state of science literacy today, and tells us what we can do to nurture scientific curiosity, build critical thinking skills and instill healthy skepticism.</p>]]></description>

<p>Ever wonder about the mathematical basis for battling a zombie infestation? Jennifer Ouellette has. In her new book <em>The Calculus Diaries</em>, the English major turned science journalist goes on an odyssey to relearn the branch of math that so intimidated her in high school. <br /> Along the way, she finds calculus in activities ranging from surfing, to catching fly balls, to playing craps in Vegas.</p>
<p>Naturally, calculus can also tell us how to stop the marauding zombies before they take over the human population for good.</p>
<p>At a time when the U.S. lags in science and math education, a book like Ouellette's—making math intriguing and accessible—is more than a good read. It’s an educational necessity.</p>
<p>Jennifer Ouellette is the author of three books: Black Bodies and Quantum Cats: Tales from the Annals of Physics, The Physics of the Buffyverse, and most recently, <em>The Calculus Diaries</em>. She has also written widely, blogs at "Cocktail Party Physics," and until recently was director of the Science and Entertainment Exchange, a National Academy of Sciences project to bridge the gap between the research community and Hollywood.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Host: Chris Mooney</p>
<p>At a recent conference in Lake Tahoe, demographer S. Jay Olshansky presented a roomful of technologists with an exciting prospect. Through a concerted scientific attack on the problem of aging, he suggested, we might be able to extend human life by as much as 7 years on average.</p>
<p>Olshansky's strategy is not simply to keep battling individual diseases, like cancer, in isolation. Rather, it’s to go after the underlying process that brings on those diseases to begin with.</p>
<p>The field of aging has long been beset by questionable claims—by hucksters try to sell us the fountain of youth. By contrast, Olshansky suggests there may be a modest, but scientifically attainable, version of human life extension that would benefit us all. On this episode of Point of Inquiry, he discusses how it might be possible, and what a world in which we all live significantly longer would look like.</p>
<p>S. Jay Olshansky is a Professor in the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois at Chicago. His work focuses on estimating the upper limits to human longevity and pursuing the scientific means to slow aging in people.  Dr. Olshansky is the author, with Bruce Carnes, of <em>The Quest for Immortality: Science at the Frontiers of Aging</em>.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a show about evolution—but not, for once, about the evolution wars. Instead, it concerns one of the most intriguing ideas to emerge in quite some time about the evolution of humans.</p>
<p>In his much discussed book <em>Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human</em>, Harvard anthropologist Richard Wrangham argues that we’ve been ignoring a critical catalyst in the creation of our species—a little technology called cooking.</p>
<p>Cooking was the game changer, says Wrangham. It upended everything. It altered how we obtained energy, which in turn morphed our anatomy and cranial capacity. Cooking even changed how we came to spend our days, and divide labor between the sexes.</p>
<p>According to Wrangham, learning to cook therefore ranks among the most important things that ever happened to our ancestors. In this episode of Point of Inquiry, he discusses why cooking was so pivotal—and why its role has so long been overlooked.</p>
<p>Richard Wrangham is the Ruth Moore professor of biological anthropology at Harvard University, and the author, with Dale Peterson, of <em>Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence</em>. His new book is <em>Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human</em>.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robert Price being off for the week, today we present a lecture given by  Dr. Price at the Center for Inquiry's annual Student Leadership  Conferece titled "Is the Bible Mein Kampf?"</p>
<p>In his talk, Price suggests the Bible has much to offer even the most  secular and non-religious of us. He discusses the value he sees in the  Bible, and what we can learn from the mistakes and contradictions found  within it. He explains that because he sees the Christian Fundamentalist  interpretation of the Bible as so wrong, a hated of this  straw man Bible might also make little sense. Price explains that critical  examination of Biblical texts is what makes a true friend of the  Bible—even if you're an atheist.</p>
<p>Along with being a usual host of this show, Robert M. Price is professor  of theology and scriptural studies at Coleman Theological Seminary and  professor of biblical criticism at the Center for Inquiry Institute. He  is a fellow of the Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion  and the Jesus Seminar. Dr. Price is the author of a number of books,  including <em>The Reason Driven Life, Deconstructing Jesus, The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man</em>, and <em>The Da Vinci Fraud</em>. He has appeared widely in the media, and was featured prominently in the movie <em>The God Who Wasn't There</em>. His latest book is <em>Top Secret: The Truth Behind Today’s Pop Mysticisms</em>.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, the scope of <em>Point of Inquiry</em> expands to include politics and more particularly, the fount of misinformation that is Glenn Beck of Fox News.

<p>But investigative journalist Alexander Zaitchick has pinned Beck to a wall with his new book <em>Common Nonsense: Glenn Beck and the Triumph of Ignorance</em>. He’s even provoked Beck into denouncing him for practicing "despicable, yellow journalism." Coming from Beck, that’s a compliment.</p>

<p>In this conversation with Karen Stollznow, Andrew speaks about being a Magician’s Magician, making multimedia magic, and not only inventing illusions but reinventing classic illusions.

<p>Andrew shares stories of his paranormal investigations for the <em>Weird Things</em> TV show and podcast, and his experiences as lead investigator for the James Randi Educational Foundation’s Million Dollar Challenge.</p>
<p>The author of the article <em>Think Skeptically, Act Locally: 50 Things You Can Do To Encourage Critical Thinking</em>, Andrew is one of the original activists in the skepticism movement.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>When President Obama was inaugurated in January of 2009, he pledged to  “restore science to its rightful place” in the U.S. government. And true  to his word, the president promptly staffed his cabinet with  distinguished scientific leaders, liberated embryonic stem cell research  from the Bush era restrictions, and released a  memorandum on  “scientific integrity” intended to reverse the kinds of problems seen in  the Bush years.</p>
<p>Since those days, however, the "scientific integrity" agenda does not  seem to have filtered through the federal government as hoped. And  according to a recent report in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, some  scientists are having problems in this administration when it comes to  speaking with the media, or having their research results properly  handled by their superiors.</p>
<p>To put these developments in context, <em>Point of Inquiry</em> called  upon Francesca Grifo, director of the Scientific Integrity Project at  the Union of Concerned Scientists. As Grifo explains, claims that the  Obama administration is behaving like the Bush administration did on  science are absurd. However, the administration must do more to deliver  on President Obama’s pledge to restore science to its "rightful  place"—and move swiftly to address reports of scientific discontentment.</p>
<p>Francesca Grifo is a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned  Scientists and an expert in biodiversity conservation, and heads up  UCS’s Scientific Integrity Project. She has testified before Congress  about scientific integrity and is widely quoted  in the press on the  topic. Prior to joining UCS, she was at Columbia University where she  ran the Science Teachers Environmental Education Program.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently in Amherst, New York, two of <em>Point of Inquiry</em>’s hosts sat down for a special in-studio episode of the show. One was a conservative (Robert Price), one a liberal (Chris Mooney)—and both were atheists.</p>
<p>The topic they tackled: Is there any necessary correlation between one’s disbelief in God and one’s place on the political spectrum?</p>
<p>The result was a fascinating—and notably civil, and frequently entertaining—conversation ranging across foreign policy, abortion, stem cell research, animal rights, and many other topics. In the end, the discussants actually found not only much disagreement, but also some common ground.</p>
<p>Robert M. Price is Professor of Biblical Criticism at the Center for Inquiry Institute as well as the editor of The Journal of Higher Criticism and a host of <em>Point of Inquiry</em>. His books include <em>Beyond Born Again,  The Widow Traditions in Luke-Acts: A Feminist-Critical Scrutiny, Deconstructing Jesus</em>, and<em>The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man. </em></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
Global warming, we're often told, is an issue we must address for the 
sake of our grandchildren. We need to cut carbon because of our moral 
obligation to future generations.
</p>
<p>
But according to Bill McKibben, that's a 1980s view. As McKibben writes 
in his new book <i>Eaarth: Making Life on a Tough New Planet</i>, the 
increasingly open secret is that global warming happened already. We've 
passed the threshold, and the planet isn't at all the same. It's less 
climatically stable. Its weather is haywire. It has less ice, more 
drought, higher seas, heavier storms. It even appears different from 
space. <br>
</p>
<p>
And that's just the beginning of the earth-shattering changes in store—a
 small sampling of what it's like to trade a familiar planet (Earth) for
 one that's new and strange (Eaarth). We'll survive on this sci-fi 
world, this terra incognita—but we may not like it very much. And we may
 have to change some fundamental habits along the way.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Eaarth, argues McKibben, is our greatest failure. <br>
</p>
<p>
Bill McKibben is a former staff writer for the <i>New Yorker</i> 
magazine, and author of the famous 1989 book <i>The End of Nature</i>, 
as well as over a dozen other works. He is currently a scholar in 
residence at Middlebury College in Vermont, and founder of the global 
warming grassroots organization 350.org, which lobbies for tougher 
climate policies. In 2009, the group conducted what CNN later called 
"the most widespread day of political action in the planet's history."

      <link><![CDATA[https://pointofinquiry.libsyn.com/tim_farley_what_s_the_harm_]]></link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
Tim Farley is a computer software engineer, skeptic, and creator of the 
popular website <i>What's the Harm</i>? His site answers this salient 
question with over 670,000 stories of people who have indeed been 
harmed, damaged, injured, or even killed by pseudoscience and the 
paranormal
</p>
<p>
<i>What's the Harm's</i> catchphrase is: "368,379 people killed, 306,096
 injured and over $2,815,931,000 in economic damages." However, these 
statistics are calculated from randomly-caught, modern cases documented 
in English-speaking countries. Many stories are left untold. How much 
bigger could the problem be?
</p>
<p>
In this interview with Karen Stollznow, Tim reveals the real-life 
dangers, and the hidden dangers, of these beliefs and practices. He 
treats the lack of regulatory bodies for these industries, and what 
recourse can be taken when harm is done. Tim talks about the question 
"What's the Harm?" as used in defense of pseudoscience and the 
paranormal, and why this is wielded as a "checkmate" argument. He 
discusses the power of anecdotal evidence, and whether people are 
influenced by cautionary tales, or more persuaded by their own personal 
experiences.
</p>
<p>
Tim is a prominent activist and a frequent speaker at events including 
Skeptics in the Pub, Skepticamp, and the James Randi Educational 
Foundation's Amazing Meetings. An expert in computer security and 
reverse engineering, he is at the forefront of the Skepticism 2.0 
movement. He talks about finding your own "niche" as an online activist,
 how you don't need to be a magician or have a PhD to be a skeptic, and 
how we all have our own expertise to bring to the skeptical movement.

<p>Through extensive archival research, Oreskes and Conway have managed to connect the dots between a large number of seemingly separate anti-science campaigns that have unfolded over the years. It all began with Big Tobacco, and the famous internal memo declaring, "Doubt is our Product."</p>

<p>Then came the attacks on the science of acid rain and ozone depletion, and the flimsy defenses of Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" program. And the same strategies have continued up to the present, with the battle over climate change.</p>

<p>Throughout this saga, several key scientific actors appear repeatedly—leaping across issues, fighting against the facts again and again. Now, Oreskes and Conway have given us a new and unprecedented glimpse behind the anti-science curtain.</p>

<p>Naomi Oreskes (Ph.D., Stanford, 1990) is Professor of History and Science Studies at the University of California, San Diego. Her research focuses on the historical development of scientific knowledge, methods, and practices in the earth and environmental sciences, and on understanding scientific consensus and dissent. She is the author of numerous noted books and papers, including a 2004 essay in <em>Science</em> entitled "The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change," which was widely cited, debated, and referenced in Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth."</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[S. T. Joshi is a leading authority on H. P. Lovecraft, Ambrose Bierce, 
H. L. Mencken, and other writers, mostly in the realms of supernatural 
and fantasy fiction. He has edited corrected editions of the works of 
Lovecraft, several annotated editions of Bierce and Mencken, and has 
written such critical studies as <i>The Weird Tale</i> and <i>The Modern
 Weird Tale</i>. His award-winning biography, <i>H. P. Lovecraft: A Life</i>,
 has already become a collector's item.
<p>
</p><p>
But critical, biographical, and editorial work on weird fiction is only 
one aspect of Joshi's multifaceted output. A prominent atheist, Joshi 
has published the anthology <i>Atheism: A Reader</i> and the 
anti-religious polemic, <i>God's Defenders: What They Believe and Why 
They Are Wrong</i>. He has also compiled an important anthology on race
 relations, <i>Documents of American Prejudice</i>. <br>
</p><p>
</p><p>
In this episode of <i>Point of Inquiry</i>, Robert M. Price talks with 
Joshi about Lovecraft and how his writings were an impetus toward 
Joshi's atheism. Along with discussing Lovecraft's views on religion, 
Joshi shares his own views on the subject. He reveals his thoughts on 
religious writers as well as the "new atheism." He explains what horror 
and fantasy literature have to offer the non-religious, and how it can in some ways take the place of religious writings.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, we learned that J. Craig Venter has at long last created a  synthetic organism—a simple life form constructed, for the first time,  by man. Let the controversy begin—and if <em>New Yorker</em> staff writer  Michael Specter is correct, the denial of science will be riding hard  alongside it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In his recent book <em>Denialism: How Irrational Thinking Hinders  Scientific Progress, Harms the Planet, and Threatens Our Lives</em>,  Specter charts how our resistance to vaccination and genetically  modified foods, and our wild embrace of questionable health remedies,  are the latest hallmarks of an all-too-trendy form of fuzzy  thinking--one that exists just as much on the political left as on the  right.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And it’s not just on current science-based issues that denialism occurs.  The phenomenon also threatens our ability to handle emerging science  policy problems—over the development of personalized medicine, for  instance, or of synthetic biology. How can we make good decisions when  again and again, much of the public resists inconvenient facts,  statistical thinking, and the sensible balancing of risks?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Michael Specter has been a <em>New Yorker</em> staff writer since 1998.  Before that, he was a foreign correspondent for the <em>New York Times</em> and the national science reporter for the <em>Washington Post</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the <em>New Yorker</em>, Specter has covered the global AIDS epidemic,  avian flu, malaria, the world’s diminishing freshwater resources,  synthetic biology and the debate over our carbon footprint. He has also  published many profiles of subjects including Lance Armstrong, ethicist  Peter Singer, and Sean (P. Diddy) Combs. In 2002, Specter received the  American Association for the Advancement of Science’s Science Journalism  Award for his article “Rethinking the Brain,” about the scientific  basis of how we learn.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>George Hrab is a composer, professional musician, singer, songwriter,  podcaster, and skeptic. George is the Host and Producer of the <em>Geologic Podcast</em>, a  popular  weekly show about music, comedy, science, and skepticism. The drummer in the band Philadelphia Funk Authority, he is a successful  multi-instrumentalist musician who has performed on-stage with Elton  John, and given a performance in the White House for Bill Clinton.    For the past fifteen years he has also been a solo artist, releasing his music independently. George’s songs tackle science, the paranormal and  pseudoscience, from the <em>Occasional Songs for the Periodic Table</em> in  which he sings to each element, to an ode to the coelacanth. George’s  latest album <em>Trebuchet</em> includes the songs <em>God is Not Great</em>,  <em>Everything Alive will Die Someday</em>, and <em>Death From the Skies</em>,   featuring “Bad Astronomer” Dr. Phil Plait.    In this episode of Point of Inquiry, Karen Stollznow speaks with George  about the “intersection” of music and skepticism, and how music fits  into critical thinking. With eclectic influences from Frank Zappa to  Carl Sagan, George describes how he infuses skepticism into his own  music.    A successful activist in the skeptical community, George not only  speaks-out against a lack of critical thinking in society, but he also  “sings-out” against this issue, promoting skepticism through song. This  “nice guy of skepticism” discusses the image of the skeptical movement,  and what we can do to popularize skepticism. He explains that he reaches people “through their funny bones and dance shoes” as an effective way  to communicate skepticism to the public, and tells us how music and  comedy can make converts to critical thinking.    George’s music brings a new audience to skepticism, and provides theme  songs for skeptics.    In many ways, George’s music has become the soundtrack to skepticism.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s hard to think of an issue more contentious these days than the  relationship between faith and science. If you have any doubt, just flip  over to the science blogosphere: You’ll see the argument everywhere.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the scholarly arena, meanwhile, the topic has been approached from a  number of angles: by historians of science, for example, and  philosophers. However, relatively little data from the social sciences  has been available concerning what today’s scientists actually think  about faith.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Today’s Point of Inquiry guest, sociologist Dr. Elaine Ecklund of Rice  University, is changing that. Over the past four years, she has  undertaken a massive survey of the religious beliefs of elite American  scientists at 21 top universities. It’s all reported in her new book <em>Science  vs. Religion: What Scientists Really Think</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ecklund’s findings are pretty surprising. The scientists in her survey  are much less religious than the American public, of course—but they’re  also much more religious, and more “spiritual,” than you might expect.  For those interested in debating the relationship between science and  religion, it seems safe to say that her new data will be hard to ignore.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Elaine Howard Ecklund is a member of the sociology faculty at Rice  University, where she is also Director of the Program on Religion and  Public Life at the Institute for Urban Research. Her research centrally  focuses on the ways science and religion intersect with other life  spheres, and it has been prominently covered in <em>USA Today</em>, <em>The  Chronicle of Higher Education</em>, <em>Newsweek</em>, <em>The Washington  Post</em>, and other prominent news media outlets. Ecklund is also the  author of two books published by Oxford University Press: <em>Korean  American Evangelicals: New Models for Civic Life</em> (2008), and more  recently the new book <em>Science vs. Religion: What Scientists Really  Think</em> (2010).</p>]]></description>

Schadewald talks about her brother's unique approach  to dealing with promoters of pseudoscience, and what he gained from it.  She discusses the timeline of Bob's research interests and how he  eventually made his way to studying creationism.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>For many of us, chemistry is something we remember with groans from high  school. Periodic Table of the Elements—what a pain to memorize, and  what was the point, anyway?</p>
<p>So how do you take a subject like chemistry and make it exciting,  intriguing, and compelling?</p>
<p>With her new book <em>The Poisoner’s Handbook</em>, Pulitzer Prize winning  journalist Deb Blum has done just that. Blum takes a page from the  "CSI" franchise, and moves that familiar narrative of crime, intrigue,  and high tech bad-guy catching back into the early days of the 20th  century. There, in jazz age New York, she chronicles the birth of  forensic chemistry at the hands of two scientific and public health  pioneers—the city’s chief medical examiner Charles Norris, and his  chemistry whiz side-kick Alexander Gettler.</p>
<p>And while chronicling their poison-sleuthing careers, Blum also teaches  quite a bit of science. Her book is a case study in science  popularization, and one we should all be paying close attention to.</p>
<p>Deborah Blum is a Pulitzer-prize winning science writer and has been a  professor of journalism at the University of Wisconsin-Madison since  1997. Prior to that, she spent over a decade working as a science writer  for the <em>Sacramento Bee</em>, where her series on ethical issues in  primate research, “The Monkey Wars,” won the 1992 Pulitzer.</p>
<p><em>The Monkey Wars</em> also became a book, and since then Blum has  written numerous others: <em>A Field Guide for Science Writers, Sex on  the Brain, Love at Goon Park: Harry Harlow and the Science of Affection</em>,  and <em>Ghost Hunters: William James and the Scientific Search for Life  After Death</em>.</p>
<p>Blum has also written for numerous publications including <em>The Los  Angeles Times</em>, <em>The Boston Globe</em>, and <em>The New York Times</em>.  She was president of the National Association of Science Writers from  2002-2004, and currently serves on advisory boards to the Council for  Advancement of Science Writing and the World Federation of Science  Journalists. </p>]]></description>

Blum takes a page from the "CSI" franchise, and moves that familiar narrative of crime, intrigue, and high tech bad-guy catching back into the early days of the 20th century. There, in jazz age New York, she chronicles the birth of forensic chemistry at the hands of two scientific and public health pioneers—the city’s chief medical examiner Charles Norris, and his chemistry whiz side-kick Alexander Gettler.</p> <p>And while chronicling their poison-sleuthing careers, Blum also teaches quite a bit of science. Her book is a case study in science popularization, and one we should all be paying close attention to.</p> <p>Deborah Blum is a Pulitzer-prize winning science writer and has been a professor of journalism at the University of Wisconsin-Madison since 1997. Prior to that, she spent over a decade working as a science writer for the <em>Sacramento Bee</em>, where her series on ethical issues in primate research, “The Monkey Wars,” won the 1992 Pulitzer.</p> <p><em>The Monkey Wars</em> also became a book, and since then Blum has written numerous others: <em>A Field Guide for Science Writers, Sex on the Brain, Love at Goon Park: Harry Harlow and the Science of Affection</em>, and <em>Ghost Hunters: William James and the Scientific Search for Life After Death</em>.</p> <p>Blum has also written for numerous publications including <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>, <em>The Boston Globe</em>, and <em>The New York Times</em>. She was president of the National Association of Science Writers from 2002-2004, and currently serves on advisory boards to the Council for Advancement of Science Writing and the World Federation of Science Journalists. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Robert Todd Carroll is a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, and author of <em>The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions</em>. He is Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at Sacramento City College, where he taught Logic and Critical Reasoning, Critical Thinking about the Paranormal, Law, Justice and Punishment, and World Religions. He is also author of the textbook <em>Becoming a Critical Thinker</em>.</p>
<p>Bob is the creator of the popular website Skepdic.com, which features numerous essays and book reviews, and the Skeptimedia blog where he provides a commentary of media coverage of pseudoscience and the paranormal. But the focus of the site is the original online version of the <em>Skeptic's Dictionary</em>, containing hundreds of entries on topics ranging from "abracadabra to zombies". This is <em>the</em> resource for defining skepticism.</p>
<p>In this episode, Karen Stollznow talks with Bob about the importance of defining the topics of which we are skeptical. They discuss the inadequacies of existing definitions of paranormal and pseudoscientific subjects, and why it is necessary to counter uncritical bias with explanations that are skeptical. However, the damning evidence (or lack-thereof) usually speaks for itself.</p>
<p>Bob reveals the top searches to his site, uncovering the themes that should be of particular concern to skeptics. He explains that his online book is reader-driven, and that user feedback and assistance has molded the shape of this dynamic resource. Even with 600 current entries in this encyclopedia-like dictionary, this is a work-in-progress that will never be finished.</p>
<p>Bob discusses skeptical activism, becoming a skeptic, and how to invent your own pseudoscience to learn critical thinking. As a life-long teacher of this topic, Bob explains that critical thinking needs to be taught, but also needs to be learned critically. We discuss how much critical thinking can or should be taught, and how much is a process of self-learning.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>For two decades now, we’ve failed to seriously address climate change.  So the planet just keeps warming—and it could get very bad. Picture  major droughts, calving of gigantic ice sheets, increasingly dramatic  sea level rise, and much more.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the idea of a technological fix to solve the  problem—like seeding the stratosphere with reflective sulfur particles,  so as to reduce sunlight—starts to sound pretty attractive. Interest in  so-called “geoengineering” is growing, and so is media attention to the  idea. There are even conspiracy theorists who think a secret government  plan to geoengineer the planet is already afoot.</p>
<p>Leading scientists, meanwhile, have begun to seriously study our  geoengineering options—not necessarily because they want to, but because  they fear there may be no other choice.</p>
<p>This week's episode of Point of Inquiry with host Chris Mooney features Eli Kintisch, who has followed these scientists’ endeavors—and their ethical quandaries—like perhaps no other journalist. He has broken stories about Bill Gates’ funding of geoengineering research, DARPA’s exploration of the idea, and recently attended the historic scientific meeting in Asilomar, California, where researchers gathered to discuss how to establish guidelines for geoengineering research.</p>
<p>And now, the full story is related in Kintisch’s new book <em>Hack the  Planet: Science’s Best Hope—or Worst Nightmare—for Averting Climate  Catastrophe</em>.</p>
<p>Eli Kintisch is a staff writer for Science magazine, and has also  written for <em>Slate, Discover, Technology Review</em>, and <em>The New  Republic</em>. He has worked as a Washington correspondent for the  Forward and a science reporter for the <em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em>.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Thomas J.J. Altizer burst onto the religious scene in the 1960s with his  book <em>The Gospel of Christian Atheism</em>. He was one of the "Death  of God" theologians discussed in the famous TIME cover story, "Is God  Dead?" Altzier holds an M.A. in theology and Ph.D. in History of  Religions from the Universeity of Chicago. Now 83 years of age, Altizer  remains a Young Turk among radical theologians, insisting that only  Christians can be true atheists and must proclaim the death of God.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this conversation with Robert Price, Altizer delves into Death of God  theology. He explains the difference between saying "There is no God"  and "God is Dead." He discusses his interactions with other theologians  and what they thought of his work. Altizer gives his opinion of  contemporary public atheists and what he likes and dislikes about them.  He relates stories from his career involving other thinkers such as Paul  Tillich and Mircea Eliade—including a personal "initiation" experience.  He explains how he formerly debated evangelical Christians and how  Death of God theology can be used when doing so. </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Kurtz is founder and chair emeritus of the Center for Inquiry and  founder of a number of other organizations. A Fellow of the American  Association for the Advancement of Science, he is Professor Emeritus of  Philosophy at the State University of New York at Buffalo, chairman of  the Committee for the Skeptical Inquiry, the Council for Secular  Humanism, and Prometheus Books. He is the author or editor of almost  fifty books, including his new title <em>Exuberant Skepticism</em>.  Throughout the last four decades, Kurtz has been a leading defender of  science and reason against the prevailing cults of irrationality in our  society, and has been interviewed widely in the media on a wide range of  subjects, including alternative medicine and communication with the  dead, to the historicity of Jesus and parapsychology.</p>
<p>In this, the third of three special-edition epsiodes featuring D.J.  Grothe, Paul Kurtz discusses American philosopher John Dewey, and  explains how his views undergird much of what the Center for Inquiry  stands for. He talks about the American school of philosophy called  pragmatism, and its central value of testing ideas by their  consequences. He explains how active inquiry, even into controversial  claims, is key for the educated mind, and why learning how to think is  more important than being instructed what to think. He explores Dewey's  humanism, and how nature and science should be servants of the human  good. He talks about Dewey's optimism and his faith in democracy, in the  common person, and in social progress. He explores how for Dewey moral  values are objective, but are not absolute, static and unchanging, but  that they should be modified in the light of new evidence and  situations. And he explains the real value of inquiry and how it may  enrich people's lives.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Scott Lilienfeld is Professor of Psychology at Emory University in  Atlanta. Scott is a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, a  Consulting Editor for <em>Skeptical Inquirer</em> and the Founder and  Editor of the CSI journal <em>Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice</em>. He’s  a  regular contributor to <em>Scientific American Mind</em>, and is <em>Psychology   Today's</em> Skeptical Psychologist, where he investigates questionable,  controversial, and novel claims in psychology. His principal areas of  research include evidence-based practices in psychology and the  challenges posed by pseudoscience to clinical psychology.</p>
<p>In this conversation with Karen Stollznow, Scott discusses his latest  book, <em>50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology: Shattering Widespread  Misconceptions About Human Behavior</em>, co-written with Steven Jay  Lynn,  John Ruscio and the late Barry Beyerstein. The book treats a staggering  300 urban legends, myths and misconceptions; this is the “Mythbusters”  of psychology.</p>
<p>Scott explains the difference between psychology and “pop psychology”,  which is fraught with what he calls “psychomythology”. He discusses how  myths develop and disseminate, and he reports that even the experts can  be deceived by these commonly-held beliefs. These myths are  unpredictable blends of fact and (mostly) fiction, but as we find out,  fact is sometimes even stranger than fiction.</p>
<p>Scott busts some surprising myths, and argues for the importance of myth busting. When we believe in these myths there are often real-world  consequences, but debunking itself carries risks. He discusses how to  counter these myths and the “unsinkable ducks”, and how to critically  evaluate future claims as we’re presented with them.</p>
<p>Aiming to “demystify psychology”, Scott is an advocate for the effective communication of psychology to the public, and also for science-based  psychology. He considers the unreliability of our intuition,  gut-feelings and our (not-so) common sense, and how science is “uncommon sense”.</p>
<p>Scott admits that human experience makes us all armchair psychologists,  and we are all susceptible to Dr. Phil-psychology and self-help books.  But self-help is more often hindrance than help. Backed up by science,  this book is the <em>real</em> self-help.</p>]]></description>

      <link><![CDATA[https://pointofinquiry.libsyn.com/victor_stenger_taking_a_stand_for_science_and_reason]]></link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Victor Stenger is Emeritus Professor of Physics at the University of  Hawaii and Adjunct Professor of Philosophy at the University of  Colorado. He is also founder of Colorado Citizens for Science. He’s held  visiting faculty positions at the University of Heidelberg in Germany,  and at Oxford in the United Kingdom, and has been a visiting researcher  at Rutherford Laboratory in England, the National Nuclear Physics  Laboratory in Frascati, Italy, and the University of Florence in Italy.  Stenger’s search career has spanned the period of great progress in  elementary particle physics that ultimately led to the current standard  model. He participated in experiments that helped establish the  properties of strange particles, quarks, gluons, and neutrinos and has  also helped pioneer the emerging fields of very high energy gamma ray  and neutrino astronomy. In his last project before retiring, Vic  collaborated on the experiment in Japan which showed for the first time  that the neutrino has mass. He is the author of many books, including <em>Comprehensible  Cosmos, The Unconscious Quantum, Not by Design, Has Science Found God,</em> The <em>New York Times</em> best-seller <em>God: The Failed Hypothesis:  How Science Shows that God Does Not Exist</em>, and <em>The New Atheism:  Taking a Stand for Science and Reason</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this, the second of three special-edition epsiodes featuring D.J.  Grothe, Vic Stenger discusses who the New Atheists oppose: not just  anti-science activists, but even those who have faith in God even if  they support science to some extent. He explores if science is itself  based on faith. He describes ways in which faith may appear to be based  on evidence. He compares evidence supporting God's existence coming from  the appearance of design in nature with evidence from the sciences  suggesting a total lack of design in the universe. He debates which  should have priority: science or atheism, and whether learning science  will lead to atheism, or if being an atheist will lead to an natural  acceptance of the scientific worldview. He defends causing offense to  believers in the name of truth, and explores to what extent such an  approach may be counter-productive at times. He explores the best ways  to "frame" atheism so as to have the most impact. He recounts his  appearance on Christian radio, and what it illustrates about  communicating atheism and rationalism. He explains why natural  explanations for events are better than supernatural explanations. He  reveals who the real audience of the New Atheists is. He talks about the  growing student freethought and skeptics movement, and why young people  are one the target audiences of the New Atheists. He explains why he  thinks within mere generations religion will fade away.

He is also founder of Colorado Citizens for Science. He’s held visiting faculty positions at the University of Heidelberg in Germany, and at Oxford in the United Kingdom, and has been a visiting researcher at Rutherford Laboratory in England, the National Nuclear Physics Laboratory in Frascati, Italy, and the University of Florence in Italy. Stenger’s search career has spanned the period of great progress in elementary particle physics that ultimately led to the current standard model. He participated in experiments that helped establish the properties of strange particles, quarks, gluons, and neutrinos and has also helped pioneer the emerging fields of very high energy gamma ray and neutrino astronomy. In his last project before retiring, Vic collaborated on the experiment in Japan which showed for the first time that the neutrino has mass. He is the author of many books, including <em>Comprehensible Cosmos, The Unconscious Quantum, Not by Design, Has Science Found God,</em> The <em>New York Times</em> best-seller <em>God: The Failed Hypothesis: How Science Shows that God Does Not Exist</em>, and <em>The New Atheism: Taking a Stand for Science and Reason</em>.</p> <p> </p> <p>In this, the second of three special-edition epsiodes featuring D.J. Grothe, Vic Stenger discusses who the New Atheists oppose: not just anti-science activists, but even those who have faith in God even if they support science to some extent. He explores if science is itself based on faith. He describes ways in which faith may appear to be based on evidence. He compares evidence supporting God's existence coming from the appearance of design in nature with evidence from the sciences suggesting a total lack of design in the universe. He debates which should have priority: science or atheism, and whether learning science will lead to atheism, or if being an atheist will lead to an natural acceptance of the scientific worldview. He defends causing offense to believers in the name of truth, and explores to what extent such an approach may be counter-productive at times. He explores the best ways to "frame" atheism so as to have the most impact. He recounts his appearance on Christian radio, and what it illustrates about communicating atheism and rationalism. He explains why natural explanations for events are better than supernatural explanations. He reveals who the real audience of the New Atheists is. He talks about the growing student freethought and skeptics movement, and why young people are one the target audiences of the New Atheists. He explains why he thinks within mere generations religion will fade away. And he talks about the righteous indignation of the New Atheists, and the moral imperative of atheists to speak out because of the harm resulting from religion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We live in a science centered age—a time of private spaceflight and  personalized medicine, amid path-breaking advances in biotechnology and  nanotechnology. And we face science centered risks: climate and energy  crises, biological and nuclear terror threats, mega-disasters and global  pandemics.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So you would think science journalism would be booming—yet nothing could  be further from the case. If you watch 5 hours of cable news today,  expect to see just <em>1 minute</em> devoted to science and technology.  From 1989-2005, meanwhile, the number of major newspapers featuring  weekly science sections shrank from 95 to 34.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Epitomizing the current decline is longtime <em>New York Times</em> science writer Andrew Revkin, who recently left the paper for a career  in academia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this conversation with host Chris Mooney, Revkin discusses the  uncertain future of his field, the perils of the science blogosphere,  his battles with climate blogger Joe Romm, and what it’s like (no joke)  to have Rush Limbaugh suggest that you kill yourself. Moving on to the  topics he’s covered for over a decade, Revkin also addresses the problem  of population growth, the long-range risks that our minds just aren’t  trained to think about, and the likely worsening of earthquake and other  catastrophes as more people pack into vulnerable places.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Andrew Revkin was the science and environment reporter for the New York  Times from 1995 through 2009. During the 2000s, he broke numerous front  page stories about how the Bush administration was suppressing science,  and launched the highly popular blog <a href="http://www.dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com">Dot Earth</a>. But last year, Revkin announced he was  leaving the <em>Times</em>. He accepted a post as a senior fellow of  environmental understanding at Pace University in White Plains, New  York, where he will focus on teaching and two new book  projects—complementing existing works like <em>The North Pole Was Here</em>,  a book about the vanishing Arctic aimed at middle and high schoolers.  In his new life, Andy will also have much more time to play with what he  dubs his “rustic-rootsy” band, Uncle Wade.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>For the scientists who study global warming, now is the winter of their  despair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the news, it has been climate scandal after alleged climate scandal.   First came “ClimateGate,” then “GlacierGate,” “Amazon Gate,” and so  on.  In public opinion polls, meanwhile, Americans’ acceptance of the  science of global warming appears to be declining.  Even a freak  snowstorm now seems to sow added doubt about this rigorous body of  research.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In response to growing public skepticism—and a wave of dramatic attacks  on individual researchers—the scientific community is now bucking up to  more strongly defend its knowledge.  Leading the charge is one of the  most frequently attacked researchers of them all—Pennsylvania State  University climatologist Michael Mann.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this interview with host Chris Mooney, Mann pulls no punches.  He  defends the fundamental scientific consensus on climate change, and  explains why those who attack it consistently miss the target.  He also  answers critics of his “hockey stick” study, and explains why the  charges that have arisen in “ClimateGate” seem much more smoke than  fire.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dr. Michael E. Mann is a member of the Pennsylvania State University  faculty, and director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center.   His research focuses on the application of statistical techniques to  understanding climate variability and change, and he was a Lead Author  on the “Observed Climate Variability and Change” chapter of the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Scientific  Assessment Report.  Among many other distinguished scientific  activities, editorships, and awards, Mann is author of more than 120  peer-reviewed and edited publications.  That includes, most famously,  the 1998 study that introduced the so called “hockey stick,” a graph  showing that modern temperatures appear to be much higher than anything  seen in at least the last thousand years.  With his colleague Lee Kump,  Mann also recently authored the book <em>Dire Predictions: Understanding  Global Warming</em>.  Finally, he is one of the founders and contributors  to the prominent global warming blog, RealClimate.org.</p>

<p>In this, the first of three special-edition epsiodes featuring D.J.

Gould, and their reluctance to criticize theism, and argues  that sometimes, contra Sagan's famous line, "absence of evidence is  evidence of absence."  He defends making a positive statement that God  does not exist -- beyond a reasonable doubt -- as opposed to merely  stating that one lacks belief in God. He wonders if authors Susan Jacoby  and Jennifer Michael Hecht should also be considered New Atheists. He  describes lines of positive evidence from cosmology, physics, biology  and neuroscience that he says necessary leads to a conclusion of  atheism.  He tells why he doesn't think the battle over evolution  education should take priority over the New Atheist's larger war on  faith, and why rationalists should not unduly seek the support of  religious moderates and religious supporters of science.  And he shares  his optimism about the growing popularity of vocal, uncompromising  atheism, especially among young people.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Ian Rowland is a Mentalist and Mind Reader living near London, UK.  The  world’s foremost authority on cold reading, he is the author of the <em>Full  Facts Book of Cold Reading</em>.  In this book, Rowland has defined and  categorized the different types of psychic readings, and created a  taxonomy of cold reading techniques.  Rowland was the first person to  lecture on cold reading to the Magic Circle and his book has been  described as “the definitive work” on the subject by Derren Brown, James  Randi, Martin Gardner, Teller, and Banachek.</p>
<p>Rowland is a prolific writer and a charismatic lecturer and entertainer  who has appeared on television numerous times and performed in many  countries around the world. Rowland performs better than the psychics.  He convinced an audience he was a psychic medium for ABC’s <em>Primetime</em>,  and during a BBC documentary one of his psychic readings was rated as  99.9% accurate.</p>
<p>In this conversation with host Karen Stollznow, Rowland explains the  history and meaning of cold reading, and how and why it works.  He  demonstrates how cold reading is a “Win-Win Game” and psychics are  “right” even when they’re wrong.  He claims that he can replicate <em>any </em> psychic ability.  Rowland  recounts some of his performances as a psychic, tarot reader,  astrologer, and medium, and his “miracles” of spoon bending, psychic  surgery, and hammering a nail into his head.</p>
<p>Rowland also discusses the practical, non-New Age applications for cold  reading, and how these strategies can be used for law enforcement and  business, but why they probably shouldn’t be used for romance.  A  qualified yet reluctant spokesperson for skepticism, Rowland presents  his “off-message skepticism”, and shares his opinion of what he thinks  the movement is doing right, and what he thinks we are doing wrong.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, there was another nail in the coffin for vaccine skeptics. The British medical journal The Lancet took the dramatic step of retracting a 1998 paper that lies at the root of modern vaccine denialism. Authored by a doctor named Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues, it was heavily touted as having uncovered a new cause of autism—the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, or, the MMR vaccine.</p>
<p>Not so fast. Twelve years later, there are more problems with the paper than you can count—and yet somehow, it managed to spawn a movement.</p>
<p>In this conversation with host Chris Mooney, Dr. Paul Offit— author of  <em>Autism’s False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search  for a Cure</em>—discusses the state of the vaccine skeptic movement in light of this latest news. In particular, Offit explores why the tides may be turning on the movement—as well as the grave public health consequences of ongoing vaccine avoidance.</p>
<p>Paul A. Offit, MD is the Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases  and the Director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s  Hospital of Philadelphia. In addition, Dr. Offit is the Maurice R.  Hilleman Professor of Vaccinology and a Professor of Pediatrics at the  University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Dr. Offit has published  more than 130 papers in medical and scientific journals in the areas of  rotavirus-specific immune responses and vaccine safety. He is also the  co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine, RotaTeq, recommended for universal  use in infants by the CDC. Dr Offit was a member of the Advisory  Committee on Immunization Practices to the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention, is a founding advisory board member of the Autism  Science Foundation, and is the author of five books, the latest of which  is <em>Autism’s False Prophets</em>.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Banachek is an American mentalist and skeptic. He has written numerous books and invented various magic and mentalism effects, and is often sought out by top entertainers such as David Blaine, Lance Burton, James Randi and Criss Angel. He has been the recipient of a number of awards and recognitions, including the Dave Lederman Memorial Award (Awarded for Creativity in Mentalism) and the Dunninger Memorial Award (Awarded for Distinguished Professionalism in the Performance of Mentalism), both awarded by the Psychic Entertainers Association, as well as the College Campus Novelty Act of the Year,  and the Entertainer of the Year on two occasions, all awarded by the Association for the Promotion of Campus Activities. He is renowned for fooling scientists at Washington University into believing that his supposed psychic abilities were genuine during the Project Alpha hoax in the early 1980s. In 2009, he conducted a preliminary test of psychic claimant Connie Sonne's dowsing ability for the James Randi Educational Foundation's Million Dollar Challenge that was witnessed by hundreds in person at The Amazing Meeting 7 in Las Vegas, NV.</p>

<p>In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Banachek recounts his origins as a mentalist in South Africa, including how James Randi's books influenced the development of his worldview. He talks about his involvement helping develop Penn and Teller's bullet catch, the current finale to their Las Vegas show. He describes his role in Project Alpha, and explores to what extent he thinks the researchers involved were aware of his and his colleague's deceptions. He details the role that magicians and mentalists may play in informing the public about psychic and other paranormal claims, and describes the virtues of being an open-minded skeptic as opposed to a "debunker." He talks about his role n the James Randi Educational Foundation's Million Dollar Challenge, and recounts his preliminary testing of Connie Sonne's dowsing ability in front of a live audience at The Amazing Meeting 7, in Las Vegas in 2009.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Frank Schaeffer is New York Times best selling author whose books include three semi-biographical novels about life in a strict, fundamentalist household: <i>Portofino</i>, <i>Zermatt</i>, and <i>Saving Grandma</i>, and also the memoir <i>Crazy For God: How I Grew Up As One of the Elect, Helped Found the Religious Right and Lived to Take All (or Almost All) of It Back</i>, which is now out in paper back.  His latest book is <i>Patience with God: Faith for People Who Don't Like Religion (or Atheism)</i>.

<p>In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Frank Schaeffer discusses <i>Crazy for God</i>, describing how he grew up in fundamentalist Christianity with his famous father, Francis Schaeffer, a leading founder of the Religious Right, and recounts his role in his father's career. He details how his relationships were affected by his leaving the movement. He explains exactly how fundamentalist Christianity took over the Republican Party. He describes the anti-democratic and anti-American elements within Evangelical Christianity. He draws a direct line from the worldview promoted by the Religious Right to the Tea Party movement, the rise of Glen Beck and Sarah Palin, the recent murder or Dr. George Tiller, and the use of biblical passages calling for the assassination of President Obama. 

<p>He shows how the Religious Right actively wants America to fail, in order to prove that it has taken the wrong path in adopting secular, democratic and humanist values. He explores how evangelical "foot soldiers" are often used by secular neoconservatives to advance political aims seemingly unrelated to Christianity, such as energy deregulation and public policies in support of the insurance lobby. He defines secular humanism, and tells how his father at once opposed humanism in his writings such as The Christian Manifesto, even while living a complex, and sometimes deeply humanistic life. Finally, he contrasts and compares the New Atheists, such as Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris, to leaders of the Religious Right, arguing that they are both not only extreme in their views, but also absolutist in their views of fundamental truth.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Randy Olson is a marine biologist and filmmaker who holds a PhD in biology from Harvard University. A graduate of the U.S.C. Cinema School in 1997, he wrote and directed the movies <i>Flock of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus</i>, and <i>Sizzle: A Global Warming Comedy</i>. His new book is <i>Don't Be Such a Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style</i>.

<p>In this interview with D.J. Grothe, Randy Olson discusses his background as a Harvard-trained scientist and tenured professor and why he changed careers to become a filmmaker. He explains the differences between science education and science communication. He recounts the social changes, beginning in the 1980's, that have harmed science education and the communication of science to the public. He describes the ways that filmmaking is ideal for public science advocacy, and how his films, such as Flock of Dodos, have unexpectedly led to further public engagement with the scientific community. He emphasizes the role of storytelling as the means to best communicate science to the public, and describes how scientific papers are like screenplays.

<p>He talks about the <i>Daily Show</i> and the <i>Colbert Report</i> as examples of how serious issues, including scientific controversies, can be communicated to the public in entertaining and engaging ways. He talks about how Stephen J. Gould and Carl Sagan exemplified ways to avoid being "such a scientist," by arousing interest and by being likable. He addresses the stereotypes of scientists as being humorless, stuffy and too literal. He describes the reaction his book has received from the science community. He criticizes the National Academy of Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science for their disinterest in science activism. He contrasts the community of scientists with other professional learned societies, such as within law or medicine. He examines the responsibility of the public to learn science even despite how effective scientists are at communicating it. And he explores the role of increasingly mainstream anti-science movements in the public's misunderstanding of climate research, evolution, and vaccinations.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Dr. Darrel W. Ray is author of three books, two on organizational psychology. He has been a psychologist for over 30 years. After practicing counseling and clinical psychology for 10 years, his focus shifted to organizational psychology and consulting. A longtime student of religion, his latest book is The God Virus: How Religion Infects Our Lives and Culture. 

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Darrel Ray talks about religion being like a virus, elaborating on Richard Dawkins' concept of the meme. He explains why the metaphor of God belief being like a virus of the mind is so useful. He details how religion is communicable, and propagated through vectors, just like biological pathogens, and why the rational "immune system" of children makes them more susceptible to the contagion. He explores why some people are immune to the God virus, and how to inoculate children from it, such as through exposure to many strains of the virus early in life. He describes the role that guilt over sex has in the success of the God virus. He discusses whether there is a skepticism virus, and why he feels atheism is a poor organizing principle, but why humanism is not. And he talks about the New Atheist agenda, and the best ways to engage in "public health measures" to protect people from the God virus.]]></description>

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Chris Mooney talks about the growing divide between science and society. He contrasts the issues addressed in The Republican War on Science with the current problems facing society as outlined in Unscientific America. He argues for the unique public policy significance of science for society, and why scientific literacy matters more than other kinds of cultural or historical literacy. He discusses the policy relevance of scientific illiteracy in terms of global warming and biotechnology. He talks about the need for scientists to become better communicators to the public. He shares his criticisms of the New Atheists and explains why their attacks against religious moderates works counter to the goal of scientific literacy. He recounts his experiences as an atheist activist while in college, and how his views have changed about campus forethought activism since that time. He explores other underlying causes of scientific illiteracy, including our educational system, the media's dysfunctional treatment of science, and growing anti-science movements such as the climate deniers and vaccine skeptics. And he details concrete actions that science advocates can take in order to increase scientific literacy.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Russell Blackford is an Australian writer, philosopher, and critic, and editor-in-chief of The Journal of Evolution and Technology. His new book, edited with Udo Schuklenk, is 50 Voices of Disbelief: Why We Are Atheists.

In this interview with D.J. Grothe, Russell Blackford explains the need for 50 Voices of Disbelief. He argues that there can be no more important question than whether religion and faith deliver on their promises. He explores whether religion will persist. He contends that religious leaders are not our society's moral leaders. He discusses a number of contributed essays in the 50 Voices collection, such as James Randi's, entitled "A Magician Looks at Religion," which explores how a background in magic may inform one's understanding of religion, and Peter Adegoke's essay, which argues that religion is impeding Nigeria's social, economic and scientific progress. He talks about how the book includes contributions from people all over the world and from every continent, except Antarctica. He discusses essays by Sumitra Padmanabhan and Prabir Ghosh that explore the harms that religion cause in India, and alternatives to religion, such as humanism. He talks about how the diversity of views in the essay collection show that there is "no party-line of atheism."  He comments on essays by psychologist and parapsychologist Susan Blackmore ("Giving Up Ghosts and Gods"), and philosopher Philip Kitcher ("Beyond Disbelief"). He discusses recent controversies over CFI's International Blasphemy Day, and opposing views of Paul Kurtz and Ron Lindsay regarding criticism of religion, and whether "moderate religion" should be criticized or viewed as an ally to advance secular, pro-science values. He talks about the relationship between atheism and progressive social values. And he argues that religion should not be allowed to remain private, and therefore beyond public scrutiny and critique.]]></description>

He is managing editor of Skeptical Inquirer magazine and author of Media Mythmakers: How Journalists, Activists, and Advertisers Mislead Us, and Lake Monster Mysteries: Investigating the World's Most Elusive Creatures (with Joe Nickell). He also writes online at LiveScience.com, MediaMythmakers.com and Monsterscience.com.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Ben Radford surveys the current issue of Skeptical Inquirer magazine, which is focused on "Skepticism 2.0" and the future of the skeptical movement. He describes various articles by contributors to the issue such as Daniel Loxton, Jeff Wagg, Karen Stollznow, Blake Smith, Heidi Anderson, Reed Esau, Tim Farley and others. He talks about blogging, podcasts and youtube and the opportunities they present for new skeptical outreach. He explores ways national skeptical organizations can collaborate. He talks about why it is important to build on the important work of skeptical luminaries such as Carl Sagan, Ray Hyman, James Randi, Martin Gardner and Joe Nickel, and how to do so. And he also talks about his sacrilegious board game Playing Gods.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Greg Craven is a high school science teacher and climate change activist from Oregon.  His new book is What's the Worst That Could Happen? A Rational Response to the Climate Change Debate.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Greg Craven discusses the youtube video on global warming he created that now has nearly 8 million views. He talks about applying game theory to the "decision paralysis" people have surrounding the global warming debate, using a "decision grid." He explores misunderstandings most people have about the nature of science, and whether or not science can provide certainty about important questions facing society. He emphasizes as a starting point the acknowledgement, whether one is a skeptic of global warming or a "panicked activist," that one could be wrong about global warming. He argues that the evidence is not what is most important in the climate change debate, because each side has "evidence" to support its conclusions. He talks about "confirmation bias," and how it makes it difficult to find out the truth about global warming. He explains why it is less important to personally live "green," and why others kinds of social environmentalist activism is more important. He details why America's mobilization in World War II and also modern social networking on the internet are the only two things that give him hope regarding responsibly responding to climate change.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>J.D. Trout is a professor of philosophy at Loyola University Chicago, and an adjunct professor at the Parmly Sensory Sciences Institute. He writes on the nature of scientific and intellectual progress, as well as on the contribution that social science can make to human well-being. He is the author of <i>Measuring the Intentional World</I>, and co-author of <i>Epistemology and the Psychology of Human Judgment</i>. His most recent book is <i>The Empathy Gap: Building Bridges to the Good Life and the Good Society</i>.

<p>In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, J. D. Trout argues for using science to engineer society in ways that help people overcome their natural cognitive biases. He notes that whether or not we know it, we are always participants in the social experiments, often experiments conducted by unqualified elected officials. He details a number of small experiments that have public policy implications, such as using social science to trick people into keeping hospitals more germ-free, public bathrooms cleaner, and prescriptions from being filled erroneously. He explores the tensions between the unfettered free market and governmental regulation in this regard, and argues that in many cases it is an empirical question as to whether the free market can solve a particular problem. He discusses the anti-vax movement, and the best strategies to adopt in order to overcome suspicions public health measures such as widespread vaccination programs. He argues that the evidence is overwhelming that the general public lacks the cognitive resources to consistently make good decisions about its well-being, and he defends this view from charges that it is "Big Brother." He makes a distinction between the public making good decisions about what priorities to pursue, and good decisions about the means to pursue them. He tells why he thinks the U.S. Government should create something like a House Committee on Social Science, and how such a Committee would offer an alternative to failed "Blue Ribbon" panels such as the Meese Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. He contends that the United States Government should have tax-payer funded "well being programs," similar to countries in Europe, as a public health measure (because happy people are healthier people). He he explains how the Obama Administration is allied with such proposals to use science to better engineer society, because Obama is an "Enlightenment President," who believes in the power of science to transform society for the better. And he describes what science activists can do to advance such an agenda.]]></description>

<p>In this interview with D.J. Grothe, J. D Trout draws distinctions between empathy and sympathy. He talks about the "empathy gap," which is a set of natural, evolved limits on empathy, and how these limits negatively affect society, such as difficulties people experience when trying to empathize with others who are religiously, culturally or psychologically different from themselves. He talks about how the results of empathy can actually be crippling for an individual. He talks about how we should use new research in the social sciences to overcome the empathy gap. He explores if new social science questions basic capitalistic assumptions of the American Dream and also philosophical concepts, such as free-will. He explains how new social science research supports the Enlightenment outlook. He details a number of well-researched cognitive biases that lead people to make bad decisions, such as the base-rate effect, overconfidence bias, the omission bias, the hindsight bias, and the availability bias, among others. He shares his skepticism that education about cognitive biases, or the adoption of "inside strategies," can diminish the negative effect of such biases. He proposes that society adopt "outside strategies," which is the government or institutions adopting policies and strategies to help the public overcome their cognitive biases, because he argues individuals will not be very successful on their own in counteracting them. And he explores to what extent these kind of institutional or governmental strategies and policies are "social engineering."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Jeff Sharlet is a contributing editor for Harper's and Rolling Stone, and a visiting research scholar at New York University's Center for Religion and Media, where he has taught journalism and religious studies. He is the coauther, with Peter Manseau, of Killing the Buddha, and editor of TheRevealer.org. His latest book, a New York Times bestseller, is The Family: The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power.

In this in-depth interview with D.J. Grothe, Jeff Sharlet explains why secularists should not assume that just because there is a Democrat in the White House it follows that the religious fundamentalists' power has waned. He talks about how a secretive Christian political organization called The Family is founded in a doctrine of "Biblical Capitalism" and the "totalitarianism of Christ" that draws no distinction between religion, economics and politics and he recounts its origins in a supposed revelation from God that attacked organized labor and stated that Christianity has historically been overly focused on the poor, the weak and the suffering. He draws distinctions between the "pulpit pounders and the Bible thumpers" and "the fundamentalist elite," which is exemplified by The Family, which is comprised almost entirely of well-educated, affluent political and business leaders. He describes how The Family organizes Congressman into "private prayer cells," and runs the C Street House, which was made famous through the political sex scandals of Senator John Ensign and Governor Mark Sanford.

He contrasts organizations like the Heritage Foundation and Christian leaders such as James Dobson and Pat Robertson with The Family, arguing that at least they are open with their agenda, as opposed to the Family, which unapologetically encourages secrecy by working to be "an invisible organization." He describes how The Family's relationship with the powerful is different than groups like Focus on the Family, and explains how their lack of rigid partisan or religious orthodoxy allows them to be more effective.  He argues that The Family literally works to subvert democracy, and how the organization celebrates Hitler, Mao and Stalin as being among the few men the 20th Century who actually "understood the New Testament." He reports that The Family acts consistently as an intermediary between US Politicians and military leaders and businessman on the one hand, and overseas dictators such as the Somali dictator Siyad Barre, Ugandan dictator Museveni, and Indonesia dictator Suharto on the other hand, often with disastrous consequences. 

He details the history and importance of the National Prayer Breakfast to The Family's agenda. He describes ways that writing his expose has resulted in a backlash against him. He lists ways that secularists and progressives can work to reduce the influence of The Family in government.  And he reveals a number of elected officials in high office who have ties to The Family, including Republican United States Senators Chuck Grassley, John Ensign, Jim DeMint, James Inhofe, Sam Brownback, and Lindsey Graham; Democratic United States Senator Mark Pryor; South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford, Former United States Attorneys General John Ashcroft and Ed Meese; and Democratic Congressmen Mike McIntyre and Bart Stupak, among others.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[William Little is a freelance journalist based in London, England. He has written for the Saturday Telegraph magazine, Weekend Telegraph, the Guardian, The Times and the Financial Times. He has also worked for Arena, Esquire and Cosmopolitan, and contributed articles to the Independent, the Daily Express and the Big Issue, among many others.  His recent book is The Psychic Tourist: A Voyage into the Curious World of Predicting the Future.

In this interview with D.J. Grothe, William Little recounts his experiences researching The Psychic Tourist, including his seminar with Sylvia Browne, meetings with UK mentalist Derren Brown, scientists Richard Dawkins and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Brian Jospehson, attending a psychic college, and his sister's star chart  predicting her death. He reveals his motivations writing the book, and talks about how his journalistic approach is different than the approach of some academic skeptics who write for more of an already skeptical audience. He explores what it might say about society if there is such widespread belief in psychics when there is so little evidence to support psychic claims. He contrasts the harm psychics do with how they may help people. He explains why he thinks of psychic belief as "disorganized religion." And he talks about the skeptics he met who weren't cold-hearted, but instead were interested in helping people. 

Also in this episode, Jim Underdown recounts his experiences with famous psychics making bad guesses, including John Edward and James Van Praagh.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Paul Kurtz is founder and chair emeritus of the Center for Inquiry and founder of a number of other organizations. A Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, he is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the State University of New York at Buffalo, chairman of the Committee for the Skeptical Inquiry, the Council for Secular Humanism, and Prometheus Books. He is the author or editor of almost fifty books, including The New Skepticism: Inquiry and Reliable Knowledge. Throughout the last four decades, Kurtz has been a leading defender of science and reason against the prevailing cults of irrationality in our society, and has been interviewed widely in the media on a wide range of subjects, including alternative medicine and communication with the dead, to the historicity of Jesus and parapsychology. 

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Paul Kurtz argues against associating secular humanism with atheism and explains whether or not he himself is an atheist. He reviews the history of the word "agnostic," and shows how it "is not a creed but a method." He explains why he is skeptical of the claims of theism. He denies that atheism is a necessary condition of secular humanism. He describes what he considers as the third "categorical imperative." He explains why he considers some atheist activists to be "fundamentalist atheists," arguing that their anti-religious stance stems from "being bruised" by religion.  He talks about why he is against CFI's support of the International Blasphemy Day, and why it is "blasphemous to the whole humanist outlook" and is contrary to the "civic virtues of democracy."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Benjamin Wiker, Ph.D., is a senior fellow at the St. Paul Center for Biblical Theology and is also a senior fellow with the Discovery Institute. His books include Answering the New Atheism and Ten Books That Screwed Up The World. His Newest is The Darwin Myth: The Life and Lies of Charles Darwin.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Dr. Benjamin Wiker talks about his book The Darwin Myth: The Life and Lies of Charles Darwin. He argues that Darwinism is a distortion of evolution, and based on the secular and atheistic influence of the "radical Enlightenment." He shares his skepticism of other historians' accounts of Darwin's anguish over the implications of his views for religious belief. He contends that Darwin was a third-generation religious skeptic, and that he had an atheistic agenda from early in his life. He relates Alfred Russell Wallace's critiques of Darwin's atheistic account of evolution by natural selection, and defends Wallace from the charges of Spiritualism. He compares evolutionists who accept natural selection with neurologists who think neuroscience may or will entirely account for the human self (without a soul), and suggests both views are based on ideology. He explains his motivations to criticize Darwin based on what he argues are the immoral effects of Darwinism in society. He links Nazism, Social Darwinism and eugenics to Darwinism. He talks about abortion in the context of the eugenics movement of the early 20th century. He discusses the "is-ought problem" in philosophy, and the "naturalistic fallacy." He criticizes Darwin's accounts of how human morality may have evolved. And he argues against  creationists who reject evolution, even while he himself attacks "evolution by natural selection."]]></description>

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Ron Lindsay describes CFI's Campaign for Free Expression, and its goals to defend free speech and oppose even self-censorship. He details the pleaseblock.us website, which is a component of the campaign, along with announcing a cartoon contest in honor of the Danish Muslim cartoon controversy of a few years back. He explores the relationship between free expression and free inquiry. He examines the recent controversy surrounding the Yale-published book on the Muslim Cartoon issue, and why the book's editors chose not to include the cartoons in the book. He talks about CFI's sponsorship of International Blasphemy Day, and its aims, which include highlighting blasphemy laws around the world, some of which carry life-sentences or the death penalty. He argues against recent United Nations resolutions against the defamation of religions. He shares details of CFI's "Blasphemy Contest." He defends the strategic utility of organizing people to blaspheme, despite the fact that it may be offensive.  And he lists some of the ways listeners can get involved celebrating Blasphemy Day at various Centers for Inquiry throughout North America and around the world.]]></description>

His books include <i>The Oxford Handbook of Developmental Behavioral Neuroscience</i>, <i>Body Heat: Temperature and Life on Earth</i>, and <i>Basic Instinct: The Genesis of Behavior</i>. He is Editor-in-Chief of the journal <i>Behavioral Neuroscience</i>, and President of the International Society for Developmental Psychobiology. His newest book is <i>Freaks of Nature: What Anomalies Tell Us About Development and Evolution</i>.

<p>In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Mark Blumberg describes how he became interested in "freaks of nature" as a way to question prevailing concepts within biology regarding genes, instincts, and pre-formed abilities. He talks about why he sees genetic determinism as "action at a distance thinking," and why he thinks it is similar to creationist views, and describes both as "magical ways of thinking about nature." He explains epigenetics. He describes how certain non-genetic factors that shape behavior may be inherited from one generation to the next. He discusses "sexual freaks" and sexual ambiguity in nature, and shows how in many ways, it is the norm in nature. He predicts the extinction of creationist thinking, and talks about how freaks of nature are a missed opportunity for those science advocates battling intelligent design and creationism, even as he also criticizes belief in "evolution's design" and "magical genes." He contrasts his views with those of evolutionary psychology as regards brain development. And he responds to notable critics of his views, such as Jerry Coyne.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[James "The Amazing" Randi is a world-renowned magician, skeptic and investigator of paranormal claims and is a central figure in the founding of the world-wide skeptical movement. Perhaps best known for the One Million Dollar Challenge, in which his educational foundation awards $1,000,000 to anyone who is able to show evidence of any paranormal, supernatural or occult power or event, under test conditions agreed to by both parties. Randi has appeared widely in the media, including on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show at least 22 times and he is also a regular on Penn and Teller's Showtime series, Bullshit!  He has received numerous awards and recognitions, including the MacArthur Genius Grant, and the American Physical Society's Forum Award for Promoting Public Understanding of the Relation of Physics to Society. He is the author of many books, including The Truth About Uri Geller, Flim-Flam! and The Faith Healers.

In this interview with D.J. Grothe, James Randi talks about the future of The Amazing Meeting, his annual popular critical thinking convention in Las Vegas. He also discusses various faith healers he has investigated, and his real motivations in doing so. He talks about the first faith healer he exposed in Toronto as a teenager. He explores reasons why faith healers he has debunked still persist in their TV empires. He shares his views of Ernest Angley. He recounts his expose of Peter Popoff, including Popoff's use of an earpiece to receive information about his congregants that they believed was revealed by the Holy Spirit.  He explains why people believe in faith healers despite evidence to the contrary. Other faith healers he criticizes include Pat Robertson and his "Words of Knowledge," V.A. Grant, Oral Roberts, and Filipino psychic surgeons, recounting some of their deceptive methods they use to beguile believers. He talks about the special place "psychic surgery" has in the Pentecostal Church. He compares faith healers' methods to the methods of psychics and "cold readers" such as John Edward, and explores whether faith healers are deliberately deceptive or are merely self-deceptive. He also debates whether faith healing might actually work on occasion, due to psychological phenomena such as the placebo effect. And he talks about the role that magicians should play in exposing frauds in the public interest.

Also in this interview, James Underdown, scientific paranormal investigator and executive director of CFI's Hollywood branch, recounts his experiences with Benny Hinn's healing crusades, and talks about how Benny Hinn may or may not be like Adolph Hitler.]]></description>

Also in this interview, James Underdown, scientific paranormal investigator and executive director of CFI's Hollywood branch, recounts his experiences with Benny Hinn's healing crusades, and talks about how Benny Hinn may or may not be like Adolph Hitler.]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Ayaan Hirsi Ali was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, was raised Muslim, and spent her childhood and young adulthood in Africa and Saudi Arabia. In 1992, Hirsi Ali came to the Netherlands as a refugee. She earned her M.A. in political science and worked for the Dutch Labor party. She has served as a Dutch parliamentarian, fighting for the rights of Muslim women in Europe, the enlightenment of Islam, and security in the West. She was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world, and by Reader's Digest  as "European of the Year." She is the author of The Caged Virgin: An Emancipation Proclamation for Women and Islam, and the acclaimed Infidel. 

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Ayaan Hirsi Ali recounts opportunities that have allowed her to become emancipated from Islam, emphasizing that every woman in Islamic societies can likewise work against oppression and "have faith in reason." She talks about how 9-11 was a turning point in her "gradual process of enlightenment" to renounce Islam. She explains why she rejects Islam and all religions, even while recognizing that religion has some positive characteristics. She draws distinctions between favorable concepts of God in Judaism or Christianity versus destructive concepts of God within Islam. She argues that Islam, unlike Christianity and Judaism, is not a just a religion, but is a political ideology at its core, and that it is fundamentally incompatible with liberal democracies. She contends that anyone who cares about the freedom of individuals should work to "defeat Islam." She recounts how gay rights figured prominently in her initial decision to speak out and write as a Muslim apostate. She explores why Islam needs its own Voltaire, and why it has been so difficult for Islam to have its own Reformation or Enlightenment. She shares examples from the Koran that demand from Muslims complete submission, even at the expense of one's empathy and conscience. She talks about reform movements within Islam, including Bahá'í, the followers of Āgā Khān, and Ahmadiyya, and why they have failed to moderate the core political ideology of the Muslim faith. She talks about every individual Muslim is commanded in the Koran both to do good and to punish evil, and the implications of this doctrine for the rule of law in society. She talks about why liberal reinterpretation of religious texts is easier in Christianity and Judaism than within Islam. She discusses her own experience of female genital mutilation, and how the practice is used to enforce the dogma of virginity. She compares and contrasts female genital mutilation with male circumcision, and argues that both practices -- cutting into the bodies of children based on religious belief -- should be stopped. She talks about her involvement in slain director Theo van Gogh's movie Submission, which focused on how Islam harms women. She defends 17-year old Rifqa Bary's decision to convert from Islam to Christianity, even though in Ayaan Hirsi Ali's view it is just going "from one superstition to another." She expresses outrage at the death threats and other reactions from the Muslim community to Bary's decision. And she explains how situations like Bary's and Van Gogh's murder, along with the death threats that she has received, only motivate her to speak out more, because "it is a worse kind of death to be alive but to be silenced."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Tom Flynn is Executive Director of the Council for Secular Humanism, and the Editor of Free Inquiry magazine. A journalist, novelist, entertainer, and folklorist, Flynn is the author of numerous articles for Free Inquiry, many addressing church-state issues, as well as the best-selling The Trouble With Christmas, about which he has made hundreds of radio and TV appearances in his role as the curmudgeonly "anti-Claus." He is also the author of the critically acclaimed anti-religious black comedy science fiction novels, Galactic Rapture and Nothing Sacred. His latest work, The New Encyclopedia of Unbelief, is a comprehensive reference work on the history, beliefs, and thinking of America's fastest growing minority: those who live without religion.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Tom Flynn talks about his new role as Executive Director of the Council for Secular Humanism, and the relationship of that organization with the Center for Inquiry, including contrasting the Council's grassroots network of secular humanist and freethought societies with the growing network of Centers for Inquiry throughout North America. He describes the Council's and CFI's new jointly sponsored Campaign for Free Expression. He explores the philosophical underpinnings of the Council for Secular Humanism, which includes advocating for and defending a nonreligious life stance rooted in science, naturalistic philosophy and humanist ethics. He criticizes the impulse among some secularist activists to avoid the term "atheism," because secular humanism presumes atheism, and he argues that secular humanists should "come out" as atheists. He explains why secularist or science activists in the political arena who strategically avoid the term "atheist" may appear to be disingenuous. But then he contrasts secular humanism with atheism, arguing that "atheism is just the beginning." He details new survey results showing that the fastest growing cognitive minority group and the only life-stance minority group that has grown over the last eight years in all fifty States is the nonreligious, and argues that between 8-10% of the U.S. population are "hard seculars," those who are explicitly atheist, agnostic, secular humanist, as opposed to people who are merely "unchurched."  He explores the possibility of more elected officials "coming out" as atheists and secular humanists, and more atheists and secular humanists getting elected to public office. And he details some factors he thinks will indicate in the near future that secular humanism and atheism have become more widely acceptable in our society.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Peter Singer has been called "the world's most influential living philosopher," by <i>The New Yorker</i> and <i>Time Magazine</i> listed him in "The Time 100," their annual listing of the world's 100 most influential people. He is DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University, and laureate professor at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics, University of Melbourne. He writes a regular column for <i>Free Inquiry</i> magazine, and is the author of dozens of books, including <i>Practical Ethics</i>, <i>Rethinking Life and Death</i>, and <i>Animal Liberation</i> (which has sold more than a half million copies), <i>Writings on an Ethical Life</i>, <i>One World: Ethics and Globalization</i>, <i>The President of Good and Evil</i> (about George W. Bush), and <i>The Way We Eat</i>. His most recent book is <i>The Life You Can Save: Acting Now To End World Poverty</i>.

<p>In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Peter Singer details how twenty-six thousand children die each day of preventable diseases and poverty worldwide, and contrasts this toll with the public's moral outrage over the blackest days in our history, such as 9/11/2001. He talks about the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth regarding the poor, and questions why most Christians today have seemed not to make ending world poverty a priority, instead focusing on issues such as abortion and homosexuality, which are not mentioned by Jesus. Singer argues that when people in affluent societies value even small luxuries more highly than saving the lives of the world's poor, that it is morally equivalent to standing by when one could easily save someone from drowning.  He says that "if you're not doing something serious to end world poverty, that you're not living an ethical life." He suggests that much philanthropy, such as charitable giving to the arts, should be less of a priority than fighting world poverty. He recommends various aid organizations that merit financial support, such as Oxfam International, and highlights GiveWell, whose purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of other aid organizations. He suggests that it is often more efficient for private organizations to administer aid than it is for governments to provide poverty relief. He argues against various challenges to his position: that giving to the poor may foster their dependence, that charity should begin at home, that the poor deserve their lot, and that our lack of concern about the world's poor may be a natural function of our evolved human nature to care primarily about our own kin. He argues that while his ethics is informed by the worldview based in the sciences and Darwinism, that it is not derived from Darwinism, and he argues against "Social Darwinism," and "the survival of the fittest." He explores the strategic implications that the demanding nature of his ethics has for its more widespread adoption in society. He talks about the meaning and sense of purpose that fighting to end world poverty may create in one's life. And he expresses the hope that skeptical and nonreligious people will become more motivated to fight world poverty, even without religious incentives, and that they will become part of a new culture of giving.]]></description>

He is also moderator for the monthly philosophy café at Harvard Book Store in Cambridge, MA. 

<p>In this interview with D.J. Grothe, Tom Clark discusses the implications of a thorough-going scientific naturalism for the concepts of the self and of free will. He contrasts "contra-causal free will" with kinds of political or social freedom, and argues that the former is a vestige of outmoded religious or dualistic thinking. He talks about compatibilism, and how he can be a skeptic of free will while also prizing personal freedom, how determinism can be compatible with certain kinds of free will. He explores what these implications of scientific naturalism might actually mean for criminal justice, and how rejecting concepts of free-will may empower society to be more humanistic and to solve social ills more effectively. And he talks about the growth of skepticism about free will, both in the academic scientific communities and in the skeptic and freethought world.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Ray Hyman is Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of Oregon and one of the leading figures of modern skepticism. He was a founding member of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (formerly CSICOP). He has been a consultant with the U.S. Department of Defense, helping investigate parapsychology for the government and is the author of many books, such as <i>The Elusive Quarry</i>, and many articles in the scholarly literature, such as his popular manuscript that teaches people how to appear to have psychic powers by using "cold reading." A former magician and mentalist, he has been featured on the cover of <i>The Linking Ring</i>, the magazine of the International Brotherhood of Magicians. Hyman was a co-recipient of the 2005 Robert P. Balles Prize in Critical Thinking, and also CSI's In Praise of Reason Award. For almost 20 years, he has run the popular Skeptics Toolbox, which trains rationalists in the best methods of advancing skepticism in our society.

<p>In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Ray Hyman recounts the history of his many critiques of the various Ganzfeld Experiments, which are scientific tests of psychic ability. He details his assessments of the later "Auto Ganzfeld experiments." He shares his evaluations of other various research projects in parapsychology, and levels criticism against some skeptics who have too hastily dismissed parapsychology's findings. He talks about his beginnings as a magician-debunker, and as a mentalist, and how he got involved in applying magic to his skeptical investigation of parapsychological claims. He explores whether or not the government should make fortune-telling illegal. He explains how leading scientists can believe in the claims of parapsychology, even without sufficient evidence. He describes some of his experiences with Uri Geller. He talks about the ethical implications of teaching non-magicians the art of cold-reading. He reveals ethical problems he has had with the Psychic Entertainers Association, and how giving psychic readings may cause real harm to clients.

      <description><![CDATA[Susan Sackett began an association with Gene Roddenberry, creator of the television legend "Star Trek," serving as his personal executive assistant for over 17 years until his death in October 1991. She also served as his production assistant on the first Star Trek film and worked closely with him on the next five Star Trek movies.  In addition, she served as Production Associate during the first five seasons of the television series, "Star Trek: The Next Generation."  She is the author of 10 books about the film and television industry. In 1994, Susan left California and relocated to Arizona, where she got involved with the Humanist Society of Greater Phoenix, for which she has been president since 2000. Since 2005, she has been on the Board of Directors of the American Humanist Association, and currently serves on the Executive Committee as Secretary.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Susan Sackett recounts her history with Gene Roddenberry and the influence he had on her, especially regarding the development of her secular humanist worldview. She talks about Roddenberry's unshakable optimism about humanity's future, and how that was expressed in his creative efforts. She discusses social justice and political messages written into the original 1960's Star Trek series, such as racial and gender equality, and allegories about the United States' involvement in Vietnam. She talks about explicitly secular humanist themes throughout Star Trek: The Next Generation, specifically in episodes like Who Watches the Watchers. She debates other topics addressed within the various Star Trek series, such as distribution of wealth, overpopulation, and the end of the nation-state, and whether or not there was a Marxist bias in the shows. And she reveals her favorite Star Trek episode, and why it is her favorite.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Michael Shermer is one of the most well-known skeptics in America, working for decades to advance the scientific outlook in society. He is a contributing editor and monthly columnist for Scientific American, and is the host of the Skeptics Distinguished Lecture Series at Caltech. Since his founding of the Skeptics Society in Southern California and Skeptic magazine, he has appeared widely on TV and radio on shows such as 20/20, Dateline, Charlie Rose, Oprah, Unsolved Mysteries, and many more. He is the author of many books, including Science Friction: Where the Known Meets the Unknown, and Why People Believe Weird Things.  His most recent book is The Mind of the Market: Compassionate Apes, Competitive Humans, and Other Tales from Evolutionary Economics.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Michael Shermer discusses skepticism and its possible relationship to libertarianism. He argues that what some organizations define as "humanism" are actually positions that have nothing to do with humanism, but with Marxism and social democracy. He talks about why he has begun speaking out more about libertarianism as a leader in the skeptical movement. He admits that he may be more of a moderate libertarian than some others who defend that political and economic perspective. He talks about tensions within libertarianism as regards national defense, and what he sees as the need for national armies after 9-11. He explains which came first for him: libertarianism or skepticism, and talks about the influence of Ayn Rand on his intellectual development. He argues that Ayn Rand is still relevant even if her view of human nature (that people are basically selfish and that there is no such thing as altruism) upon which her economic theories are based is not born out by recent developments in cognitive and evolutionary psychology. He talks about Adam Smith, and how this year is the 250th anniversary of  his first book, A Theory of Moral Sentiments, which presents his views regarding people's natural propensity for empathy and sympathy.  He defends free market capitalism despite what some consider recent wholesale failures of the market, and criticizes Alan Greenspan's betrayal of free market ideals. He attacks the current economic system which engages in corporate welfare and "economic tribalism" for being "capitalist in profits but socialist in losses." Other topics he touches on include the gold standard, tax revolt anarchism, income redistribution, and how he would prefer religion and the private sector to help the poor as opposed the government providing for the welfare of the economically disadvantaged. He defends the growing disparity between the super rich and the very poor, and the position that most poor people in the West deserve their lot in life due to their own bad decisions. He talks about his book The Mind of the Market and why people believe weird things about money. He explores the implications of the burgeoning fields of behavioral economics and neuroeconomics for his libertarian position. He describes the basic elements of evolutionary economics, a field he has pioneered. And he defends the position that skepticism should not remain apolitical — instead, he argues that skeptics should apply their skepticism to religion and God, pseudoscience and the paranormal, and also economics and politics.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dale McGowan has edited and co-authored <i>Parenting Beyond Belief</i> and <i>Raising Freethinkers</i>, the first comprehensive resources for nonreligious parents. He writes the secular parenting blog <i>The Meming of Life</i>, teaches nonreligious parenting seminars across the United States, and serves as executive director of Foundation Beyond Belief, a 501(c)(3) humanist charitable and educational foundation based in Atlanta. In September 2008 he was named Harvard Humanist of the Year by the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard University.

<p>In this interview with D.J. Grothe, Dale McGowan talks about raising freethinking children who are steeped in the values of science and humanism. He confronts some of reasons why some nonreligious parents may continue to raise their children in a religion, including moral education, identity and community. He describes trends within the scientific rationalist and humanist movements to provide secular community, which he argues are being driven by freethinking families. He talks about ways that church is increasingly becoming replaced by secular communities, and how churches are increasingly becoming more like secular community centers, as opposed to worship centers. He argues that raising freethinkers is the opposite of indoctrinating children in atheism, secular humanism or skepticism, emphasizing that "freethinking" is an approach to knowledge as opposed to a worldview. He also argues that parenting should not be focused on the value of inquiry and scientific skepticism, but on wonder, mystery and awe. He talks about the dangers of inculcating elitism among freethinking children. He explains why teaching about religion to freethinking children is important. He addresses ways of confronting death and the meaning of life with freethinking children, including how highly unlikely it is that any of us even exist. He talks about alternatives to lying to children about heaven, including facts from physics about the atoms in our bodies having existed since the beginning of the universe, and how such scientific truths may take on mystical pantheistic meanings. He talks about new social science research on happiness, and how it relates to and informs secular parenting. And he cautions that applying the best social science to parenting shouldn't mean that we make our children our next science project. 

<p>Also in this episode, Michael Blanford, founder of the Skeptical Society of St. Louis and coordinator for the Life Science Lab for the St. Louis Science Center, shares an audio essay about the awe of science for children and why freethinkers should be more emotionally engaged when celebrating evolution as the story of life.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[David Koepsell is an author, philosopher, and attorney whose recent research focuses on the nexus of science, technology, ethics, and public policy. He is Assistant Professor, Philosophy Section, Faculty of Technology, Policy, and Management at the Technology University of Delft, in The Netherlands, andSenior Fellow, 3TU Centre for Ethics and Technology, The Netherlands. He is also the author of The Ontology of Cyberspace: Philosophy, Law, and the Future of Intellectual Property, as well as numerous scholarly articles on law, philosophy, science, and ethics.

In this interview with D.J. Grothe, David Koepsell discusses the implications of corporations patenting parts of the human genome, and how current patent practices negatively impact basic scientific research in genetics. He reviews the history of the practice of patenting genes and contrasts private ownership of gene sequences found in nature with that of the public ownership of the work of the Human Genome Project. He contrasts discovery with invention, and argues that patents should apply only to the latter. He details the relationship of human genes being patented with the practices of big agribusiness owning engineered crops, such as Monsanto's "terminator corn." He discusses the ACLU's recent lawsuit against Myriad Genetics on behalf of scientists and cancer patients, and how it may lead to one of the most important legal battles in the history of biotechnology. He talks about "upstream" and "downstream" patents, and how this impacts genetic research. And he discusses various solutions currently proposed for the problems resulting from private ownership of naturally occurring gene sequences.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Dr. Jeffrey Schweitzer is an author, scientist and public speaker who has traveled widely speaking to varied groups about the application of the scientific worldview to public policy and ethical questions. He has published more than one hundred articles in an eclectic range of fields, including neurobiology, marine science, international development, environmental protection, and even aviation. He formerly served as assistant director for international affairs in the Clinton White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. He is a featured blogger on Huffington Post. His new book is Beyond Cosmic Dice: Moral Life in a Random World.

In this interview with D.J. Grothe, Dr. Jeffrey Schweitzer argues that adopting the scientific view of human origins has implications for understanding that morality is a consequence of our biology. He argues that religion puts humanity on a pedestal, and why that is dangerous. He contends that religion has failed to morally guide humanity, and he attacks religion for impeding the moral development of humanity and for causing much human suffering. He explains that religion results from fear of death, an attempt to understand the universe, achieve social cohesion and political power, and an attempt to control our fate by appealing to gods. But he argues that in the age of science, these reasons are no longer compelling. He denies that science has become a religion in itself. He explores if and how religion and science ask different questions, and if science can answer the existential questions that religion attempts to answer. He argues that life has no ultimate meaning, and that he derives this fact from science, while denying that this leads to nihilism. He discusses existentialism and contrasts it with his scientific worldview. He argues against the concept of free will as a false concept of religion, and discusses the implications this has for moral responsibility. He talks about the biological component to human morality, and defends his position from the charge of moral relativism, while admitting a kind of cultural relativism. He discusses Social Darwinism, and distinguishes core values from social values that progress over time. He explains components of his moral view, and compares his view with scientific or secular humanism. And he suggests that humanity is at a crossroads where our continued survival is uncertain, and describes the kind of behaviors consistent with a natural ethic that may be key to humanity's surviving the future.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Kurtz is founder and chair of the Center for Inquiry and a number of other organizations. A Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, he is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the State University of New York at Buffalo, chairman of the Committee for the Skeptical Inquiry, the Council for Secular Humanism, and Prometheus Books. He is the author or editor of almost fifty books, including <i>The New Skepticism: Inquiry and Reliable Knowledge</i>. Throughout the last four decades, Kurtz has been a leading defender of science and reason against the prevailing cults of irrationality in our society, and has been interviewed widely in the media on subjects ranging from alternative medicine and communication with the dead, to the historicity of Jesus and parapsychology.

<p>In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Paul Kurtz discusses the rationale for changing the name of CSICOP to the Committee of Skeptical Inquiry. He argues that the organized skeptical movement should apply the methods of scientific and skeptical inquiry to religion, and not just to paranormal claims, and he contrasts this approach with a direct atheistic assault on belief in God. He argues that while skepticism is essential to science, that the skeptical movement should promote the application of the methods of scientific inquiry into politics and economics, and talks about how divisive this may be within the skeptical movement. He considers whether political and economic questions are as amenable to critical thinking and skeptical inquiry as are paranormal claims. He talks about global warming and the extent to which the scientific community should be attentive to "global warming skeptics." He explains why he is cautious of certainty, contrasting certain knowledge with reliable knowledge, and recounts examples in the history of science when widely believed scientific theories were overturned by a small minority of new theorists. He talks about political and economic views he once held that he no longer holds. He contrasts skeptical inquiry with the classical skepticism of ancient Greece and Rome. And he argues that the new skepticism is not negative nor nay-saying, but rather is an affirmative and constructive philosophical worldview.]]></description>

He considers whether political and economic questions are as amenable to critical thinking and skeptical inquiry as are paranormal claims. He talks about global warming and the extent to which the scientific community should be attentive to "global warming skeptics." He explains why he is cautious of certainty, contrasting certain knowledge with reliable knowledge, and recounts examples in the history of science when widely believed scientific theories were overturned by a small minority of new theorists. He talks about political and economic views he once held that he no longer holds. He contrasts skeptical inquiry with the classical skepticism of ancient Greece and Rome. And he argues that the new skepticism is not negative nor nay-saying, but rather is an affirmative and constructive philosophical worldview.]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Bruce M. Hood is chair of the Cognitive Development Center in the Experimental Psychology Department at the University of Bristol. He was a research fellow at Cambridge and has been a visiting scientist at MIT and professor at Harvard. Hood has received many awards for his work in child development and cognitive neuroscience. His newest book is <i>Supersense: Why We Believe in the Unbelievable</i>.

<p>In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Bruce M. Hood explains how his agenda is different than the common skeptical agenda to disprove supernatural claims, and instead is an attempt to explain why people believe hold such beliefs in the first place. He argues that everyone is born with a "supersense," an instinct to believe in unseen forces and to recognize patterns and infer their causation, citing examples such as seeing Jesus in a grilled cheese sandwich, or the case of the "haunted scrotum." He explains how this supersense is universal, and that even skeptics and rationalists often exhibit it in their lives through rituals and the owning certain valued possessions, such as Richard Dawkins' prizing of objects once owned by Charles Darwin or MIT growing saplings from the tree under which Newton first discovered the laws of gravity. He details how rituals give a perceived sense of control to believers, and how they may actually affect a believer's performance. He talks about the "secular supernatural," contrasting it with the "religious supernatural." He argues against Daniel Dennett's and Richard Dawkins's thesis that religious belief results primarily from indoctrination in childhood. And he defends the position that unbelievable beliefs serve important social functions.]]></description>

Her writing has appeared in Salon, Wired, National Geographic, New Scientist, and the New York Times Magazine.  Her latest book is Bonk: the Curious Coupling of Science and Sex.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Mary Roach reveals why she looks to science rather than to religion for answers about death and sex, and why she is interested in such topics in the first place. She talks about the history of sex research, including Leonardo Da Vinci's anatomical explorations of coitus, as well as 19th century sex research connected to fertility and STDs. She talks about religious opposition to scientific research of human sexuality, and how it affects funding. She describes some on Alfred Kinsey's research that showed the diversity of sexual activity in the United States. She details various scientific attempts to improve human sexuality, including grafting additional testicles on men, or surgically relocating women's clitorises. She explores the role of the placebo effect in certain sexual cures, such as for impotence or increased arousal. And she talks about the link between sexual satisfaction and overall happiness.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Dacher Keltner is professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, director of the Greater Good Science Center, and coeditor of Greater Good magazine. His research focuses on the prosocial emotions, such as love, sympathy and gratitude, and processes such as teasing and flirtation that enhance bonds. He has conducted empirical studies in three areas of inquiry: the determinants and effects of power, hierarchy and social class; the morality of everyday life, and how we negotiate moral truths in teasing, gossip, and other reputational matters; and the biological and evolutionary basis of the benevolent affects, including compassion, awe, love, gratitude, and laughter and modesty.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Dacher Keltner explores the evolutionary origins of human goodness, challenging the view that humans are hardwired to pursue self-interest and to compete. Based on his studies of human emotion, he argues instead that survival is not a matter of who is the fittest, but perhaps who is the kindest -- that people may have compassion built into their brains, nervous systems, and genes. He talks about the influence of Charles Darwin on his work studying human emotions. He elaborates on Darwin's position that sympathy is our strongest evolved instinct, and what everyday behaviors such as smiling, shrugging, and hand-shakes tell us about the conditions of our deep evolution as primates. He talks about how he is taking the Darwinian approach of looking at moment by moment expressions of emotion and asking how these emotions shape a meaningful life. He explains why he looks to science, as well as to secular Eastern philosophy such as Confucianism, for answers about a meaningful life, rather than to Western religions. He describes his concept of the Jen ratio, and how it relates to the neuroscience of happiness. And he explains what the scientific study of positive emotions and activities such as smiling, laughter, teasing, touching, love, gratitude and awe may suggest about happy marriages, well-adapted children, and healthy communities.]]></description>

<p>In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Austin Dacey details his trip to Geneva, Switzerland on behalf of the Center for Inquiry's UN mission. He describes the UN lobbying efforts of the Center and its response to the United Nations Human Rights Council's resolution "Combatting the Defamation of Religions." He explains that despite legitimate concerns about stereotyping Muslims or racial profiling, this resolution equates any criticism or satire of religious beliefs with bigotry. He contrasts Europe's position on free speech with the United States' and how it is used by Islamic countries to justify their blasphemy laws, which often carry mandatory sentences of death or life in prison. He talks about how the Organization of the Islamic Conference at the United Nations aims to build into international human rights such legal standards that actually outlaw offensive speech against religions. And he argues that what should be protected under international human rights laws are individuals, and not ideas — that persons should be protected from harm and discrimination, as opposed to ideologies being protected from being criticized or satirized.]]></description>

A columnist for Art Calendar magazine, Maisel is a creativity coach and creativity coach trainer who presents keynote addresses and workshops nationally and internationally. His new book is The Atheist's Way: Living Well Without Gods.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Eric Maisel addresses atheists who don't always find it easy to live as atheists, as well as religious believers who have doubts. He describes how the atheistic scientific worldview offers more advantages than the religious perspective. He encourages an understanding of the "tradition of atheism," and explains how to derive inspiration from it. He talks about how new atheists may cope with the loss of their church communities, even when they satisfy important human needs. He details the "main problem" for atheists, which he argues is making meaning in an indifferent universe. He talks about the importance of the atheist actively self-creating, being the hero of her own story, defending a radical individualism. He talks about existential depression that atheists may experience, and ways to respond to this nihilism and ultimate meaninglessness in the universe. And he defends the position that each atheist should be an "active moral philosopher," and "make his own ethics."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Jerry A. Coyne has been a professor at the University of Chicago in the department of ecology and evolution for twenty years. He specializes in evolutionary genetics and works predominantly on the origin of new species. He is a regular contributor to <i>The New Republic</i>, the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, and other publications. His most recent book is <i>Why Evolution Is True</i>.

<p>In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Jerry Coyne talks about extent and breadth of the evidence for evolution and how the reasons for believing in evolution are not as clearly argued in today's textbooks as they were fifty years ago. He contends that professional evolutionists may take evolution on faith, or on the authority of their intellectual forerunners. He explains how evolution is both a theory and a fact. He details the various kinds of evidence for evolution, including evidence from the fossil record, molecular biology, embryology, the existence of vestigial organs, biogeography, and from bad design. He explores how Darwin discovered evolution by natural selection without the evidence from the fossil record. He explains how sexual reproduction is the key to evolution, and talks about sexual selection. He discusses the Intelligent Design movement and exactly how many scientists are actually proponents of ID. He lists some genuine controversies within evolution, and states that they are indeed taught in the schools. He discusses the relationship of belief in evolution to disbelief in God. And he explains why he feels the need, as a scientist, to publicly speak out in defense of Darwinism.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Norm Allen is executive director of African Americans for Humanism, an educational organization primarily concerned with fostering critical thinking, ethical conduct, church-state separation, and skepticism toward untested claims to knowledge among African Americans.  He is the editor of the ground-breaking book African-American Humanism: An Anthology, AAH Examiner, and Deputy Editor of Free Inquiry magazine. He has traveled and lectured widely throughout North America, Europe, and Africa and his writings have been published in scores of newspapers throughout the U.S. He has spoken on numerous radio and television programs and his writings have appeared in such books as Culture Wars and the National Center for Science Education's Voices for Evolution.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Norm Allen discusses black history in the context of science and secularism. He talks about the Senegalese physicist Cheikh Anta Diop, and his humanistic views which were coupled with his science advocacy. He talks about Charles Drew, and his influence on setting up the first blood banks, as well as urban legends that have developed around him. He talks about the pseudoscience of supposed alternative medicine cures for AIDS, and their prominence in the black community. He talks about other black scientists and freethought figures, and defends the argument for the need for a "Black History Month."  He describes the need for skepticism in the black community, focusing on how the black media covers psychics and belief in prophecy, citing examples of Tony Brown and Montel Williams. He also details some of the current black leaders in the skeptical movement, recounting the first African skeptical conference that he attended last year in Senegal.]]></description>

For many years he practiced law in Washington, DC, and was an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and American University, where he taught jurisprudence and philosophy courses. His new book is Future Bioethics: Overcoming Taboos, Myths, and Dogmas.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Ron Lindsay recounts his nearly thirty year history with the organization, including his role in a landmark legal case in Alabama regarding the question of whether or not secular humanism is a religion, elaborating on how the argument has been used since by the religious right. He describes the relationship of the "family of organizations" at the Center for Inquiry, including the Council for Secular Humanism and the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (formerly CSICOP), giving their histories. He talks about Paul Kurtz' inspiring and foundational role in all of these organizations and in the worldwide movements that they support. And he talks about why it is more important now than ever to get involved at the grassroots to advance the scientific and secular values of the Center for Inquiry, even with President Obama in the White House, highlighting concerns he has with Obama's positions on a number of issues.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>David J. Linden, Ph.D., is a Professor in the Department of Neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. His laboratory has worked for many years on the cellular substrates of memory storage in the brain, among other topics.  He has a longstanding interest in scientific communication and serves as the Chief Editor of the <i>Journal of Neurophysiology</i>.

<p>In this broad discussion with D.J. Grothe, David Linden challenges widespread beliefs about the brain, such as that people only use ten percent of it and that it is amazingly designed, arguing instead that the brain is "accidental." He talks about why, as a brain scientist, he writes about topics such as love, God and sexual orientation. He describes the downsides of how the brain has evolved by including systems from previous brain "models," and how this has given rise to those qualities that most profoundly shape our human experience. He discusses the neuron, and how it is a "lousy processor of information," describing how evolution has nonetheless used it to build "clever us." He talks about how our brains have constrained us, and may have physically led to the necessity of marriage, family and long childhoods. He surveys various claims regarding the enhancement of our cognitive capacities, such as playing Mozart to babies in utero, vitamins, smart drugs, mental exercises, and physical exercise. He talks about the brain science of homosexuality. And he argues that the brain has evolved to make everyone a "believer," describing the similarities between belief in science and in religion, that both are similar "branches of the same cognitive stream."]]></description>

He then attended Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, where he studied under Dr. William Lane Craig and received a Th.M. degree in philosophy of religion. Before leaving the church, he had ministries in Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana, and taught at several Christian colleges. Today he still teaches as an adjunct instructor in philosophy at Kellogg Community College and has an online blog devoted to "debunking Christianity." His new book is Why I Became an Atheist: A Former Preacher Rejects Christianity.


In this interview with D.J.

He critiques the Christian illusion of moral superiority. He challenges religion with what he calls the "outsider test."  He explores whether logic and reason led to his atheism, or followed only after he adopted an atheistic point of view for emotional reasons. And he explains what he does believe in now that he no longer believes in Christianity or God, and the benefits he thinks this new worldview brings him.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Kendrick Frazier has been the editor of Skeptical Inquirer magazine for over 30 years. He is a member of the National Association of Science Writers and the American Geophysical Union. In 2005, Frazier was made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science for "distinguished contributions to the public understanding of science through writing for and editing popular science magazines that emphasize science news and scientific reasoning and methods." He is the author of a number of books, including The Hundredth Monkey: And Other Paradigms of the Paranormal, Encounters With the Paranormal: Science, Knowledge, and Belief, and Paranormal Borderlands of Science.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Kendrick Frazier discusses his long association with CSI (formerly CSICOP) and with Skeptical Inquirer magazine and explores the meanings of skeptical inquiry, both as ordinary common sense and as being continuous with science. He contrasts the paranormal with science, and explains why the paranormal was the initial focus of CSICOP. He explores debates within the skeptical community, such as whether or not belief in the paranormal is diminishing, and to what extent the movement has been successful. He talks about the breadth of claims currently dealt with at the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, including both popular paranormal claims and more controversial scientific and scholarly subjects. He talks about three recent issues of Skeptical Inquirer focused on "deniers" and explains how deniers are different than skeptics. He explains paranormal or pseudoscientific claims that he has changed his mind about over the years, such as extraordinary human perception, and the mind-body connection as it relates to healing. He talks about how the magazine has dealt with religion over the years. And he talks about the future of skepticism and the need for new ways of outreach, especially to younger skeptics.]]></description>

He has been a news executive and consultant to government and the private sector for thirty years, advising clients on emerging information management technologies and the evolution of the information economy. His previous positions include vice president of the Washington Post Company, senior vice president of the Minneapolis Star and Tribune, and executive editor of United Press International.

In this interview with D.J.

He discusses the paradox that in the age of information, it may be more difficult to make good decisions. He describes "false knowledge" and how to choose the right information to pay attention to. He emphasizes the value of skepticism in making good decisions, and of trusting ambiguity and uncertainty. He uses the example of the sinking of the Titanic to explain the concept of "information errors." He discusses how groups naturally discourage dissent, and how this harms the information system, citing examples from operating room and airline cockpit. He details ways of organizing that lead to better decision-making. And he talks about the political domain, and how to address challenges to good collective decision-making in a democracy, contrasting the Bush and Obama administrations.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Ginger Campbell, M.D., is an emergency physician whose long-standing interest in philosophy and science motivated her to begin podcasting in 2006. While her Brain Science Podcast focuses on neuroscience, her other show, Books and Ideas, often explores the intersection between science and religion. She is also the founder of sciencepodcasters.org, which is a site devoted to promoting science through podcasting.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Ginger Campbell recounts how she first got involved in science podcasting, and why she focuses on neuroscience as her topic. She discusses the impact of Jennifer Michael Hecht's work on both her intellectual pursuits and her views about atheism and religion.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Ginger Campbell, M.D., is an emergency physician whose long-standing interest in philosophy and science motivated her to begin podcasting in 2006. While her Brain Science Podcast focuses on neuroscience, her other show, Books and Ideas, often explores the intersection between science and religion. She is also the founder of sciencepodcasters.org, which is a site devoted to promoting science through podcasting. In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Ginger Campbell recounts how she first got involved in science podcasting, and why she focuses on neuroscience as her topic. She discusses the impact of Jennifer Michael Hecht's work on both her intellectual pursuits and her views about atheism and religion.

      <description><![CDATA[Simon Singh is an author focusing on science and mathematics for the general public. His books include Fermat's Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem, The Code Book, and Big Bang. He has produced a number of documentaries for television on science topics, and is a trustee of the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts, and the National Museum of Science and Industry, both in the United Kingdom. He is currently being sued for libel by the British Chiropractic Association for comments he wrote in a column in The Guardian. His newest book, co-authored with Dr. Edzard Ernst, is Trick or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Simon Singh talks about being an open-minded skeptic regarding  complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). He discusses the efficacy of various CAM treatments, such as detox programs, homeopathy, and acupuncture. He examines the origins and claims of chiropractic, whether it works, and how it may be dangerous. He talks about the limits of scientific inquiry, and when a CAM claim might justifiably be dismissed. He discusses the funding of research into CAM versus the funding of its marketing. He explores the reasons why people continue using such treatments despite the lack of scientific data showing that it works. He explains the placebo effect and its legitimate therapeutic uses, and details the harm that some CAM treatments can cause even if they do work. He shares his opinions about why passions among skeptics and believers regarding CAM are so heated, giving advice to both the CAM and scientific communities. And he gives reasons for speaking out regarding CAM despite the possible negative repercussions from various quarters of the CAM community.]]></description>

A journalist, novelist, entertainer, and folklorist, Flynn is the author of numerous articles for Free Inquiry, many addressing church-state issues, as well as the best-selling The Trouble With Christmas, about which he has made hundreds of radio and TV appearances in his role as the curmudgeonly "anti-Claus." He is also the author of the critically acclaimed anti-religious black comedy science fiction novels, Galactic Rapture and Nothing Sacred. His latest work, The New Encyclopedia of Unbelief, is a comprehensive reference work on the history, beliefs, and thinking of America's fastest growing minority: those who live without religion.

In this interview with D.J. Grothe, Tom Flynn discusses the trouble he has with Christmas. He also explores the relationship of atheism and skepticism with science fiction. He talks about the connection that many of the leading figures in science fiction have had with the Center for Inquiry over the years. He surveys influential atheist and humanistic writers in science fiction including H.G. Wells, Robert Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov, Douglas Adams, Phillip Pullman, and Kurt Vonnegut, among many others. He discusses the secular humanism in Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek franchise, and an interesting connection an episode had with Scientology. He details Orson Scott Card's relationship with secular humanism. He talks about the influence of Robert Heinlein's earlier works on the development of his own religious skepticism. He discusses the similarities of Scientology and Mormonism with science fiction. He examines the intersection of sci fi and religious satire, as in the works of James Morrow and Bo Fowler. And he explains his own foray into science fiction, with his critically acclaimed books Galactic Rapture and Nothing Sacred.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Paul Kurtz is the leading figure in the humanist and skeptical movements over the last four decades. He is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the State University of New York at Buffalo. As chair of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), the Council for Secular Humanism, and Prometheus Books, and as editor-in-chief of Free Inquiry Magazine, he has advanced a critical, humanistic inquiry into many of the most cherished beliefs of society for decades. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and has been featured widely in the media on topics as diverse as reincarnation, UFO abduction, secular versus religious ethics, communication with the dead, and the historicity of Jesus. 

During this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Paul Kurtz discusses the importance of creativity in terms of outreach for the skeptical and secular humanist movements. He talks about the his book Forbidden Fruit, which focuses on the application of science and reason to the Good Life and to normative ethics. He argues that ethics need not have religious foundations, and that ethics should instead have purely secular and humanist sources. He explores the secular meanings of stories about the mythical Garden of Eden, and actually celebrates the eating of the fruit of the tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and of the fruit of the Tree of Life. He argues that the universalistic ethics within the world's religions in fact stem from secular humanism. He details what it is to live a life of excellence and defends against the charge that his ethics is self-centered and self-absorbed, arguing for good will in a secular context, and that the common good is not alien to enlightened self-interest. He touches on the secular position on controversial social issues, such as abortion and sexual ethics, including gay rights and gay marriage. He expounds on what he calls the "common moral decencies," which he argues are a product of evolution. He finishes by discussing the myth of Sisyphus and what it portends for the scientific secularist today, arguing against nihilistic atheism.]]></description>

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Solomon Schimmel reveals whether he is an atheist and explains why he lives an Orthodox Jewish lifestyle without theism. He explores differences between his religiosity and that of fundamentalists, especially in terms of truth claims, and the values of honesty and knowledge. He describes the response he has received in the Orthodox Jewish community as a result of his views. He describes the psychology of the fundamentalist, and mechanisms such as confirmation bias, selective interpretation, and ad hominem attacks of critics. He explores various views of truth, including that the value of religion is not necessarily in the truth value of its claims. And he debates the value of reason versus emotion, and the role of authority when evaluating truth claims. He explores ways that rationalists can challenge fundamentalism, both in terms of argumentation and community, and in terms of focusing on the harms of fundamentalism.]]></description>

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Schimmel discusses how and why, even as a complete skeptic of theological claims, he still practices Orthodox Judaism. He talks about the benefits that religion, including fundamentalism, may bring a believer, such as caring and supportive communities, ethical codes, means of coping with stress and loss, celebrations of rites of passage, and a hope for life after death. He explores ways that people can experience these benefits while rejecting the unreasonable claims of religion, which he argues are especially pronounced in fundamentalism. He challenges Sam Harris's view regarding moderate religionists making room for fundamentalism. He examines many of the ways that Christian, Jewish and Islamic fundamentalism harms society, and argues that it should be challenged in public and in private, for the sake of democracy, scientific progress and the welfare of society. And he details some strategies to encourage people to give up their harmful and false beliefs and fundamentalist commitments.]]></description>

In this conversation with D.J.

She explains what she means by the kind of doubt she believes in, how it is broader and deeper than mere disbelief, and the ways in which doubt can feed belief. She explores the implications of doubt for scientific inquiry, and how doubt should be applied to the questions and the certitude that some scientists and skeptics express. She talks about the importance of art, poetry and psychoanalysis for doubting, and how such forms of introspection and expression increase the benefits of doubt. And she reveals some her favorite doubters in history, and what she learns from them.]]></description>

He is the winner of the 2002 Shoemaker NEO Grant. He has appeared widely in the media, having actively promoted science and debunked pseudoscience for over 35 years, focusing on belief in UFOs and astrology. He is the founder and chairman of the Tucson Skeptics and a Scientific Consultant to the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. In this interview with D.J. Grothe, James McGaha talks about his astronomer- beginnings as a skeptic of UFOs, and the limitations of the term "UFO." He answers how open-minded he is about the possibility that extraterrestrial beings are visiting the earth today. He talks about the origins of UFO belief with the science fiction magazine Amazing Stories, along with Fate, a magazine promoting paranormal belief. He talks about the history of Project Bluebook and the Condon Report. He details qualities of human perception that may explain UFO accounts, and explores some of the reasons people may adhere to UFO belief. He explains the famous Phoenix Lights sightings. He explores how to respond to those who have unshakable belief in unsupportable UFO claims. He compares qualities of contemporary UFO mythology with certain aspects of religious belief, including views of apocalypticism and salvation. And he talks about the dangers that belief in UFOs pose to a civil society.]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[One of the most controversial and influential philosophers alive today, Peter Singer is DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University, and laureate professor at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics, University of Melbourne. He writes a regular column for Free Inquiry magazine, and is the author of dozens of books, including Practical Ethics, Rethinking Life and Death, Animal Liberation, and Writings on an Ethical Life.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Peter Singer defends vegetarianism, arguing that we should give equal consideration to all "beings who have interests." He draws ethical distinctions between human fetuses and animals, such as dogs and cats. He argues against "dominionism," which is the idea that humanity is special, and that other animals were made by God for humanity's benefit. He attacks "speciesism," and explains why he did not sign the Humanist Manifesto 2000. He describes factory farming, and the commercial imperatives that he says cause animals to be treated as mere property. He talks about the decision to become a vegetarian, and what keeps secularists and scientists from making the decision, in terms of the question he posed to Richard Dawkins at a recent Center for Inquiry conference. And he considers how working with the religious may advance vegetarianism in society.]]></description>

In this episode for Halloween 2008, Joe Nickell, the world's leading paranormal investigator and the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry's senior research fellow, and D.J. Grothe (both of whom are former professional magicians) conduct the Center for Inquiry's 12th Annual Houdini Seance, using artifacts of the magician's art to entice Houdini's spirit to appear. They recount the history of the original Houdini Seance, and explore Houdini's views on the spirit world, and to what extent he was a "debunker," as opposed to an investigator. They talk about his skeptical methods, such as going undercover, and how he used his background in magic to aid his investigations. And as commemoration, Joe Nickell reads from Houdini's famous book on skeptical investigations, A Magician Among the Spirits.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Edward Tabash is a constitutional and civil rights lawyer in Beverly Hills, California. He has chaired the National Legal Committee of Americans United for Separation of Church and State since 1995, and has argued and won before the California Supreme Court. He also sits as a part-time judge for the Los Angeles County Superior Court system. He has successfully represented the scientific outlook and secular humanism in public debates against the leading Christian philosophers around the world. In addition to serving on the Board of the Center for Inquiry and chairing the Council for Secular Humanism's First Amendment Task Force, he chairs the Center for Inquiry's Los Angeles branch.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Edward Tabash explores issues valued by secularists and why they hang in the balance in this U.S. Presidential Election.  He talks about gay marriage and abortion, and how both of these rights depend on a government neutrality in matters of religion. He details ways that pseudoscience and junk science are used to advance religiously derived public policy arguments against gay marriage and abortion. And he talks about global warming skepticism, and the need for scientific integrity in public policy. He emphasizes how the next U.S. President will reshape the Supreme Court, and what that portends for science and secular values. He also explains his role in gay rights victory with the Supreme Court of California earlier in 2008, and why he opposes Proposition 8, a proposed ballot measure in California that would amend the State Constitution to deny marriage rights to homosexuals.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Lawrence M. Krauss is Foundation Professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration and Director of the new Origins Initiative at Arizona State University. He is an internationally famous theoretical physicist who focuses on the early universe, the nature of dark matter, general relativity and neutrino astrophysics.  He has investigated questions ranging from the nature of exploding stars to issues of the origin of all mass in the universe. He is the author of seven best-selling books, including the international bestseller, The Physics of Star Trek and Hiding in the Mirror: The Mysterious Allure of Extra Dimensions from Plato to String Theory and Beyond. Dr. Krauss is one of North America's leading activists for the public understanding of science and has been particularly involved in issues at the intersection of science and society, leading efforts by scientists to defend the teaching of science in public schools, and he has been a strong proponent of scientific integrity in government.  His essay in the New York Times about evolution and Intelligent Design in May 2005 helped spur a controversy that ultimately caused the Catholic Church to refine its position on Darwinian evolution.  Most recently he has led the call for a Presidential Debate on Science and Technology as a member of the steering committee for ScienceDebate2008.org.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Lawrence Krauss explores the fear of physics, noting that some of it stems from the fact that physics contradicts basic beliefs that many people have about their place in the universe. He also addresses how others are afraid of physics because of its potential to destroy civilization, such as with atomic and nuclear weapons, and the Large Hadron Collider in Europe. He explains some of the science behind the LHC. And he talks about the misuse of quantum physics in the New Age movement, and Rhonda Byrne's The Secret and the documentary What The Bleep Do We Know.]]></description>

A recipient of the Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship, he has published articles in many journals, including Philosophy and Literature, Journal of the History of Ideas, and the Journal of Colonialism & Colonial History. University Press of Florida has recently published his book, African American Atheists and Political Liberation: A Study of the Socio-Cultural Dynamics of Faith, which was named a "Choice Outstanding Academic Title" for 2007. He is currently working on his second book, which is tentatively titled: Modernist God States: A Literary Study of the Theological Origins of Totalitarianism.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Michael Lackey talks about black liberation atheism, and the view among certain black intellectuals that belief in God results in racial inequality. He explores the black intellectual critique of the Enlightenment and of humanism, and how this has played out in post-modernist skepticism of science and reason in the academy. Focusing on Richard Wright, he explains the view that the real value of science is how it is democratic, not necessarily that it leads to "the truth". And he talks about the correspondence theory of truth and why he rejects it.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Greg Long is a professional writer, investigative journalist, and editor who lives in Washington state. He has been researching and writing about "mysteries" and unexplained phenomena of the Pacific Northwest for twenty-five years. His work has been featured on radio and television, including the Discovery Channel. His most recent book is The Making of Bigfoot: The Inside Story. 

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Greg Long discusses the famous Roger Patterson Bigfoot film from 1967, and why he says it is a hoax.  He details his argument about Patterson's motivations, evidence from the costumer's perspective on why the creature in the film is almost certainly a man dressed in an ape suit, and the confession obtained from the person who wore it. He offers theories about why belief in the creature is so widely held, and what role the media plays in the public's belief in Bigfoot. He examines the recent reports of Bigfoot in the Atlanta area. And he explores the psychological reasons people may believe in Bigfoot, including how it may symbolize certain truths about humanity's evolutionary origins. He also argues why such skeptical inquiry into possibly trivial matters like Bigfoot is so important in our society.]]></description>

His work has been featured on radio and television, including the Discovery Channel. His most recent book is The Making of Bigfoot: The Inside Story. In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Greg Long discusses the famous Roger Patterson Bigfoot film from 1967, and why he says it is a hoax. He details his argument about Patterson's motivations, evidence from the costumer's perspective on why the creature in the film is almost certainly a man dressed in an ape suit, and the confession obtained from the person who wore it. He offers theories about why belief in the creature is so widely held, and what role the media plays in the public's belief in Bigfoot. He examines the recent reports of Bigfoot in the Atlanta area. And he explores the psychological reasons people may believe in Bigfoot, including how it may symbolize certain truths about humanity's evolutionary origins. He also argues why such skeptical inquiry into possibly trivial matters like Bigfoot is so important in our society.]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Andrew Fraknoi is the Chair of the Astronomy Program at Foothill College near San Francisco. In 2007, he was selected as Professor of the Year for the state of California by the Carnegie Endowment for Higher Education. For 14 years, Fraknoi served as the Executive Director of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, and was editor of its popular level magazine, Mercury, and its newsletter for teachers, The Universe in the Classroom. He has edited two collections of science articles and science fiction stories for Bantam Books, and is the lead author of Voyages through the Universe, one of the leading astronomy textbooks in the world, and also the children's book Disney's Wonderful World of Space. Fraknoi serves on the Board of Trustees of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute, and is also a Fellow of the Committee for the Skeptical Inquiry, specializing in debunking astrology. He has received the Annenberg Foundation Prize of the American Astronomical Society (the highest honor in the field of astronomy education), as well as the Klumpke-Roberts Prize of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (given for a lifetime of contributions to popularizing astronomy) and the Gemant Prize of the American Institute of Physics.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Andrew Fraknoi explains the history of the atoms in our bodies, and how we are literally made of "star stuff." He details how scientists know the history of these atoms, and explores the implications of this "simple but profound fact," and how some people derive mystical meaning from it, while others find it humbling. He talks about the compatibility of religion with astronomy, and the proper role of skepticism in the science classroom. He describes current threats to science education. And he makes a case for popularizing science and astronomy, and how this benefits society.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Barbara Oakley, PhD, has been dubbed a female Indiana Jones — her writing combines worldwide adventure with solid research expertise. Among other adventures, she has worked as a Russian translator on Soviet trawlers in the Bering Sea, served as radio operator at the South Pole Station in Antarctica, and risen from private to regular army captain in the U.S. Army. Currently an associate professor of engineering at Oakland University in Michigan, Oakley is a recent vice president of the world's largest bioengineering society and holds a doctorate in the integrative discipline of systems engineering. Her new book is Evil Genes: Why Rome Fell, Hilter Rose, Enron Failed, and My Sister Stole My Mother's Boyfriend.

In this interview with D.J. Grothe, Barbara Oakley shares her criticisms of the research of influential social scientists such as Philip Zimbardo and Stanley Milgram, and explains why the biological sciences should be brought to bear on research about human evil. She addresses how her thesis in Evil Genes might be used as an excuse by some people in our society to do bad things, and details specifics from the life of her sister that serve as a window into her exploration of human evil. She also addresses the implications of her thesis for organized religion, arguing contra Christopher Hitchens that religion is not evil per se but that it might attract evil people to its institutions.]]></description>

<p>In this conversation with D.J.

He argues that evolution must be mythologized in order to save our species. He explains how he reinterprets orthodox Christian doctrines such as "personal salvation," "the centrality of the cross," and "original sin" in ways that are compatible with scientific ways of thinking, and recounts how understanding evolutionary brain science helps reinterpret certain notions of sexual "sin." He addresses the criticism that that there is no good reason to use religious language to speak about science and evolution.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Allan Mazur discusses his interest in skepticism, and lists various criteria for disbelief, defending "closed-mindedness" about various implausibilities. He explores similarities in the credulity throughout the United States versus Europe and Asia. He details the implausibility of various beliefs about the inerrancy of the Bible, UFOs, and astrology, and explains how there is nothing unique about religious beliefs that make them more implausible than other unsupportable claims. He examines the origins of implausible beliefs, including social influence, and how one's social milieu may be a stronger factor in determining one's beliefs than evidence or one's education.

Harrison is a graduate of the University of South Florida with degrees in history and anthropology. he currently lives in the Cayman Islands, where he is a columnist and travel writer for a national newspaper. He has won several international awards for his writing and photography.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Guy P. Harrison talks about his new book 50 Reasons People Give For Believing In A God, and details such reasons for god-belief as the obviousness of God, "playing it safe," the fear of hell, that belief in gods brings genuine happiness and comforts, and the fact that so many people are religious. He explores similarities between the reasons people give for their belief in Western gods and Eastern gods, and also similarities between the reasons people give for belief in gods and in the paranormal.  He calls for a wider understanding of religion in general as an important first step in inculcating skepticism about religion. He argues that the reasons people proffer are often very different than the reasons theologians argue that people should believe. And he offers advice for what he thinks is the best approach for engaging believers on these matters of belief.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Lewis Wolpert is Professor of Biology as Applied to Medicine in the Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology of University College, London, focusing his research on the mechanisms involved in the development of the embryo. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society, and the Royal Society of Literature. He has presented science on both radio and TV for years, and was Chairman of the Committee for the Public Understanding of Science in the UK. Among his books are Malignant Sadness: The Anatomy of Depression (the basis for the BBC documentary entitled 'A Living Hell") The Triumph of the Embryo, and A Passion for Science (with Alison Richards). His most recent book is Six Impossible Things Before Breakfast: The Evolutionary Origins of Belief.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Lewis Wolpert explores the evolutionary origins of belief, and argues that atheism is unnatural while belief in gods is not. He details the relationship between tool-making and belief in God, and shows how human primates are unique in this regard. He explains why he thinks it is so hard for people to give up their unbelievable beliefs. He shares his views on organized religion, including how it benefits believers, and examines if the same tools of science and reason can equally be applied to beliefs about the paranormal. He also debates the usefulness of argumentation with believers.]]></description>

And he surveys various scientific approaches of examining religion, such as rational choice theory, the secularization hypothesis, and various evolutionary approaches, such as group selection theory, the byproduct theory of religion, and memetic approaches (that religion is a "virus of the mind").]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Robert M. Price is professor of theology and scriptural studies at Coleman Theological Seminary and professor of Biblical Criticism at the Center for Inquiry Institute. He's a fellow of the Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion and the Jesus Seminar. Dr. Price is the author of a number of books such as The Reason Driven Life, Deconstructing Jesus, Incredible Shrinking Son of Man, and The Da Vinci Fraud. He has appeared widely in the media, and was featured prominently in the movie The God Who Wasn't There. His latest book is Top Secret: The Truth Behind Today's Pop Mysticisms.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Robert Price explores the origins, doctrines and dangers of various strands of contemporary "pop mysticism," including Rhonda Byrne's The Secret and other "New Thought" proponents, the movie What the Bleep Do We Know?, Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, Eckhart Tolle, Marianne Williamson, and The Course in Miracles. He contends that there is some truth to many of these mystical worldviews, especially the emphasis on introspection and self-improvement, and details how to take what is of value while rejecting the unsupportable claims.  He also addresses the popularity and influence of Christian televangelist Joel Olsteen, whom he argues is in fact a promoter of New Thought in Christian trappings. He also explores what the secular humanist and skeptic movements might learn from both the Christian Mega-churches and the New Age movements, and how they can work together as freethinkers against fundamentalist dogmatic religious-political movements.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Jamy Ian Swiss is universally considered one of the world's top sleight of hand performers, famous to magicians for his subtlety, skill and depth of understanding of magic's history. He has appeared on a number of television programs in the United States, Europe, and Japan, including on The Today Show, CBS's 48 Hours, Comedy Central, CNN, PBS Nova and the PBS documentary, The Art of Magic. He's performed internationally for corporate clients, lectured to magicians in over a dozen countries, and is a co-producer of New York City's longest-running Off-Broadway magic show, Monday Night Magic. He is also a co-founder of the National Capital Area Skeptics and the New York City Skeptics, and a long-time contributor to the skeptical movement and its magazines.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Jamy Ian Swiss talks about his skeptical beginnings, and argues that magic done well is an "entertaining form of skepticism, rather than a debased form of mysticism" (as described by Adam Gopnik in the recent profile of Jamy in "The New Yorker").  He explores some of the philosophy of why and how magic works, and examines ethical and artistic issues related to the performance of contemporary magic and mentalism, as reflected n the work of a spectrum of performers ranging from Derren Brown to Marc Salem to Uri Geller.  He also wonders about the effectiveness of the skeptical movement overall, and the value of getting involved in the skeptical community.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Paul Kurtz, considered by many the father of the secular humanist movement, is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the State University of New York at Buffalo. As chair of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), the Council for Secular Humanism, and Prometheus Books, and as editor-in-chief of Free Inquiry Magazine, he has advanced a critical, humanistic inquiry into many of the most cherished beliefs of society for the last forty years. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and has been featured very widely in the media, on topics as diverse as reincarnation, UFO abduction, secular versus religious ethics, communication with the dead, and the historicity of Jesus.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Paul Kurtz describes the Center for Inquiry's transnational efforts, detailing its activities to advance science and secular values in the Netherlands, Romania, Germany, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, Canada and various countries in Africa, the Middle East and South America. He shares some of the history of the worldwide skeptical and humanist movements, and shows how the recent worldwide expansion of the Center for Inquiry is a result of its commitment to what he calls "planetary humanism."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Austin Dacey serves as a respresentative to the United Nations for CFI, and is also on the editorial staff of Skeptical Inquirer and Free Inquiry magazines. His writings have appeared in numerous publications including the New York Times and USA Today. His new book is The Secular Conscience: Why Belief Belongs in Public Life.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Austin Dacey argues for the objectivity of morality from a nonreligious perspective. Maintaining that the conscience is prior to and independent of God and religion, he advocates an "ethics from below" that steers a middle course between an empirical "science of good and evil" and a transcendental religious ethic. While sharply criticizing what he sees as simplistic and misleading applications of evolutionary science to moral matters, Dacey defends a naturalistic understanding of the right and good. He explains the advantages of consequentialist moral theories that seek to promote individual well-being, and returns to John Stuart Mill's On Liberty to show that the belief in objective values is perfectly compatible with the social philosophy of secular liberalism. Dacey also responds to Chris Hedges' assertions that secularists do not grasp the nature of evil and that the Enlightenment notion of moral progress is a myth.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Marc Hauser is an evolutionary psychologist and biologist. He is Harvard College Professor and Professor of Psychology, and Director of the Primate Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory at Harvard University. He is the author of a number of books, including The Evolution of Communication, Wild Minds: What Animals Think, and Moral minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong.

<p>In this interview with D.J. Grothe, Marc Hauser expounds his theory that morality has biological origins while challenging the common view that morality comes from God. He compares the human capacity for morality with Noam Chomsky's notion of a universal grammar, arguing that there is a "morality module" in the brain. He explains how his theory accounts for differences in morality across cultures, and discusses how morality could have evolved and what genetic benefit it might have afforded. He also explores the implications of his theory for the legal system, and for cultural institutions like religion and the family.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Sir Harold Kroto, winner of the 1996 Nobel Prize for Chemistry, is in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at The Florida State University. He is a tireless science educator who gives lectures, presentations and workshops to groups of all ages with the aim of communicating his passion for science. He's a fellow of the Royal Society, and was awarded its 2002 Michael Faraday Award for public appreciation of science.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Sir Harold Kroto relates what budded his initial interests in science, including the influence of his childhood Meccano sets, and emphasizes the importance of hands-on exploration and science learning. He recounts the discovery of the Buckminster Fullerene, for which he won the Nobel Prize, and the frustration he has with people outside the sciences who view science as only worthwhile if it is "useful." He discusses his views on religion, and how his background in science has fueled his freethinking and religious skepticism. He explores the question of whether or not science education efforts are succeeding, and details his "buckyball" workshops for children. He also explores whether or not he advances the "religion of secular humanism" when he teaches science deliberately excluding any mention of God or religion.]]></description>

His writings have appeared in numerous publications including the New York Times. His new book is The Secular Conscience: Why Belief Belongs in Public Life.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Austin Dacey argues that secularism has lost its sense of moral direction, ceding ground to religious positions it never should have. He explores the impact this has on the secular left's criticism of the New Atheists, and its approach to radical Islam. He discusses the reasons secular liberalism doesn't ally itself with the secularizing elements in the Islamic world, and why he thinks it should, also addressing "Islamophobia" and the "American Taliban." He explains why questions of conscience and morality, whether religious or secular in origin, should not be excluded from public discourse -- contrary to prevailing secular liberal opinion -- and also in what sense they should (and should not) merely be matters of private belief and freedom of conscience.]]></description>

He has traveled and lectured widely throughout North America, Europe, and Africa and his writings have been published in scores of newspapers throughout the U.S. He has spoken on numerous radio and television programs and his writings have appeared in such books as Culture Wars and the National Center for Science Education's Voices for Evolution.<br/><br/>In this wide-ranging discussion with D.J. Grothe, Norm Allen explores some of the challenges advancing science and secularism within the African American community. He examines the pressure to conform to the religious ideal among various black skeptics and atheists, including many historical African American figures such as Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Nella Larsen, and Faye Wattleton, former president of Planned Parenthood of America. He debates whether religion is a liberating or oppressive force for African Americans. He also details many anti-science trends in the Black community, including those coming from Black entertainment outlets promoting anti-science such as psychic 900 lines, televangelists and belief in prophecy. He ties all of this discussion to an exploration of religion and secularism as they relate to political activism, including the influence of such high-profile Black preachers such as Reverend Jeremiah Wright, Senator Barack Obama's spiritual advisor.]]></description>

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Lynne Kelly examines differences in paranormal beliefs between Australia and the United States, and whether such beliefs are growing.  She talks about various paranormal topics from her book, including crop circles, psychic detectives, and communicating with the dead, and explains how to best convey a skeptical approach to students when addressing such topics.

      <description><![CDATA[Edward Tabash is a constitutional and civil rights lawyer in Beverly Hills, California. Graduating magna cum laude from UCLA in 1973, he graduated from Loyola Law School of Los Angeles three years later and was admitted to the California Bar that same year. He has chaired the National Legal Committee of Americans United for Separation of Church and State since 1995, and has argued and won before the California Supreme Court. He also sits as a part-time judge for the Los Angeles County Superior Court system. He has successfully represented the scientific outlook and secular humanism in public debates against the leading Christian philosophers around the world. In addition to serving on the Board of the Center for Inquiry and chairing the Council for Secular Humanism's First Amendment Task Force, he chairs the Center for Inquiry's Los Angeles branch.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Edward Tabash explores issues of science and secularism relating to the 2008 U.S. Presidential election. He surveys the stances of the candidates of both the Republican and Democratic parties as regards church-state separation, gay rights, abortion rights, global warming and other topics important to the pro-science secularist, regardless of his or her political leanings. Tabash also emphasizes the crucial importance of this election due to the Supreme Court appointments the next President will make.

Also in this episode Toni Van Pelt, CFI's Director of Government Affairs, details ways listeners can get involved with CFI's activities on Capitol Hill through its Office of Public Policy.]]></description>

and other publications. He has taught philosophy at University College
of London, Oxford, and Rutgers University, and is a distinguished
professor of philosophy at the University of Miami. He is best known
for his work in the philosophy of mind, but has published across the
subjects of modern philosophy. He was featured in Bill Moyers' series <span style="font-style: italic;">Faith and Reason</span> on PBS and also Jonathan Miller's <span style="font-style: italic;">Atheism Tapes</span>, a BBC documentary series.<br/>
<br/>
In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Colin McGinn explores various
kinds of skepticism, giving his concerns about radical fallibilism and
certain post-modern critiques of knowledge. He explains how he is
certain that ghosts and Gods don't exist. He details how atheistic the
profession of philosophy is, and how the tolerance shown while
philosophers criticize each other serves as a model for good
citizenship. He tells the reasons that led to his religious skepticism
and atheism. He examines William Shakespeare as a philosopher, the
problem of evil in Shakespeare's plays, and other philosophical
subjects found in Shakespeare such as epistemology, ethics, life after
death, happiness and the meaning of life. He also explains how getting
into Shakespeare as a professional philosopher impacted his philosophy.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Lawrence M. Krauss is Ambrose Swasey Professor of Physics, Prof of Astronomy, and Director of the Center for Education and Research in Cosmology and Astrophysics at Case Western Reserve University. The author of 7 popular books including international bestseller, The Physics of Star Trek, and the award winning, Atom, and his newest book, Hiding in the Mirror: The Mysterious Allure of Extra Dimensions from Plato to String Theory and Beyond, Krauss is also a regular radio commentator and essayist for newspapers such as the New York Times, and appears regularly on television. He is the only physicist to have been awarded the highest awards of the American Physical Society, the American Association of Physics Teachers, and the American Institute of Physics, and is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He has been particularly active leading the effort to defend the teaching of science in public schools, and to help define the proper limits of both science and religion, as well as defending scientific integrity in government. His essay in the New York Times on Evolution and Intelligent Design in May 2005 helped spur a recent controversy that has helped refine the Catholic Church's position on evolution.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Lawrence Krauss discusses the role scientists should serve in our society. He also details the sorry state of scientific literacy in America today, as well as some strategies for confronting the problem. He makes a case for why learning the methods and outlook of science is important in our democracy, even if it undermines society's basic beliefs about religion or the paranormal. And he challenges Richard Dawkins' methods of communicating the implications of science, even while applauding Dawkins for defending the place of the nonreligious in society.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CFI supports a growing network of campus groups on about 200 campuses throughout North America and around the world. While this is a much smaller number than its "cultural competitors," with groups like Campus Crusade for Christ having an annual operating budget of $380 million, Center for Inquiry's campus groups are able to have an increasing impact through the dedication and vision of its student leaders.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, eight student leaders of CFI campus groups explore questions of mission and focus, as well as obstacles they face as they seek to advance science and secularism at the high school and college levels. They debate various strategies for outreach, and detail their successes, including events they have organized and faculty supporters they have discovered. They talk about the problem of how to present themselves to their wider learning community and how welcoming they should be of students who don't share their worldview. They also emphasize the importance of open-ended free inquiry, and how they see their goals as continuous with the university itself.]]></description>

He is the author of a number of critically acclaimed books, such as The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, Unweaving the Rainbow, The Devil's Chaplain, and The Ancestor's Tale. His most recent title is the best selling The God Delusion which is now out in paperback.<p>In this candid discussion with D.J. Grothe recorded in front of a live audience at the recent Secular Society and Its Enemies conference, Richard Dawkins discusses the impact of his book The God Delusion, whether or not his uncompromising attack on religion undermines science education, and how people can find meaning in a godless universe. He also explores strategies for advancing atheism in society and highlights what secularists may learn from the gay rights and feminist movements.

His research areas include the psychology of reasoning and rationality and the psychology of reading, which explores what happens in the brain and to the brain through the process of reading. Recently, he was named one of the 25 most productive educational psychologists. His many books include How to Think Straight about Psychology, Who Is Rational?: Studies of Individual Differences in Reasoning, The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Stanovich talks about his book The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in an Age of Darwin, which is about "Universal Darwinism" and its implications for widely and deeply held beliefs such as God, free-will, and the concept of the self. He explores the gene's eye view of life and also memes as self-replicating units of cuture, and how these selfish replicators use humans as vehicles for their own purposes, even as they might not be in the best interest of humans. He shows some ways that we may overcome, or rebel, against these forces to construct meaning from our existence.]]></description>

He currently holds Britain's only Professorship in the Public Understanding of Psychology at the University of Hertfordshire. He frequently appears in the media, and has written over 60 academic articles and several books, including the best-selling The Luck Factor. His newest book is Quirkology: How We Discover the Big Truths in Small Things. 

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Richard Wiseman discusses "Quirkology," areas of psychology where many scientists fear to tread. He explores some practical applications of social psychology, detailing how we can more effectively detect liars, the use of critical thinking in detecting patterns in our lives, and how to be more informed about the psychology behind supernatural or paranormal experiences.  He mentions the youtube successes that he has had in bringing social psychology to a wider public. He also discusses the importance of magic and legerdemain in exploring social psychology, and the relationship of Quirkology to other fringe areas of study such as research into psychic phenomena and parapsychology.]]></description>

In this episode, recorded on Halloween, Joe Nickell, the world's leading paranormal investigator and CSI's senior research fellow, and D.J. Grothe (both of whom are former professional magicians) conduct CFI's 11th Annual Houdini Seance. They also recount episodes in the history of Spiritualism, including details from the lives of the Fox Sisters and the Davenport Brothers, and Houdini's involvement investigating the religion of Spiritualism and his relationship to the Davenports. They discuss Lilydale, the Spiritualist community in Western New York, and talk about some of the secret methods Houdini exposed when challenging the mediums of his day. They conclude by exploring what might be the best balance between skepticism and compassion when investigating paranormal and spiritualistic claims.]]></description>

Tabash also addresses questions of meaning in a godless universe, and what atheists should do with their atheism.]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Massimo Pigliucci is professor of Ecology and Evolution at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and is well known as an outspoken critic of creationism and advocate of the public understanding and appreciation of science. A recipient of the Dobzhansky Prize from the Society for the Study of Evolution, he has been awarded three times the Oak Ridge National Laboratories Science Alliance Faculty Research Award. He is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. His research in science focuses on genotype-environment interactions, on natural selection, and on the constraints imposed on the latter by the genetic and developmental makeup of organisms. As a philosopher, he is interested in epistemological issues in the philosophy of science and in the conceptual examination of fundamental ideas underlying evolutionary theory. Pigliucci writes regularly for <span style="font-style: italic;">Skeptical Inquirer</span> and is the author of a number of books, including <span style="font-style: italic;">Phenotypic Integration</span>; <span style="font-style: italic;">Denying Evolution: Creationism, Scientism, and the Nature of Science</span>; and <span style="font-style: italic;">Phenotypic Plasticity</span>. His most recent book, co-authored with Jonathan Kaplan, is <span style="font-style: italic;">Making Sense of Evolution: The Conceptual Foundations of Evolutionary Biology</span>.<br/><br/>In this interview with D.J. Grothe, Massimo Pigliucci discusses both the methods and the concepts of evolutionary biologists and what may be wrong with them. He explores ideas in the history of evolutionary theory, such as natural selection, evolvability, and the levels at which evolution by natural selection operates (gene, individual, superorganism, or species). He also discusses why he says scientists, especially evolutionary biologists, need to do more philosophy than they are now doing.<br/><br type="_moz"/>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Peter H. Gilmore is the High Priest of the Church of Satan. He has been interviewed on numerous television and radio programs dealing with the topic of Satanism, including spots on The History Channel, BBC, The Sci-Fi Channel, and Bob Larson's Christian radio show. In 1989, he and his wife Peggy Nadramia began publishing The Black Flame; a Satanic journal, and continues to publish issues sporadically. In 2005, Gilmore provided a new introduction to LaVey's The Satanic Bible, and his essay on Satanism was published in the "Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature." On Walpurgisnacht 2007, The Satanic Scriptures was released, which is his newest collection of essays and writings on atheism and Satanism. 

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Peter Gilmore explores the similarities of atheism and Satanism, how science and Darwin's theory of evolution may undergird its worldview and ethics, and how Satanism is a theatrical "nonreligion." He also shares his opinions about recent strategies to popularize atheism, and contrasts Satanic ethics with other nonreligious ethical perspectives such as secular humanism and Objectivism.]]></description>

She has written on psychological topics for the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, Scientific American, Skeptical Inquiry, and many other publications. A Fellow of the American Psychological Association and the Association for Psychological Science, and a member of the editorial board of Psychological Science in the Public Interest, she is also a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. Her new book is Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts, co-authored with Elliot Aronson, one of the most distinguished social psychologists in the world.

In this wide-ranging discussion with D.J. Grothe, Carol Tavris explains "cognitive dissonance," and how it can lead to self-deception and self-justification. She talks about the ways that reducing dissonance leads to real-world negative effects in the areas of politics, law, criminal justice, and in interpersonal relationships. She also explores what dissonance theory says about confronting those who hold discredited beliefs, what dissonance theory may say about religious and paranormal belief, and the role of the scientific temper in avoiding the pitfalls of cognitive dissonance.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Philip Kitcher is the John Dewey Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University. An eminent philosopher, he is the author of many books on science, literature, and music, including Abusing Science: The Case Against Creationism; The Lives to Come: The Genetic Revolution and Human Possibilities; and Science, Truth, and Democracy. Concerning himself mostly with the philosophy of science, he has also had influence in the study of the ethical and political constraints on scientific research, the evolution of altruism and morality, and the possible conflict between science and religion. His most recent book is Living with Darwin: Evolution, Design, and the Future of Faith (Oxford University Press, 2006).

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Philip Kitcher explores the implications of Darwinism for both literalist religion, and for liberal faith, and to what extent the implications of Darwin's theory for belief in God should be taught in the public schools. He also discusses the role and benefits of religion, and explores alternatives to it, such as secular humanism, and offers ideas for how secular humanism might become more popular in society.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Joe Hoffmann, formally at Oxford, is director of Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion (CSER). He has appeared widely in the media and at venues across the United States speaking on Christian origins, the historical Jesus, the proper role of religion in society, and similar topics. He is the author or editor of a number of books, including Just War and Jihad: Violence in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
 
In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Dr. Hoffmann details a new project involving scholars from many disciplines that is trying to determine the likelihood of Jesus of Nazareth having ever existed. The goal of The Jesus Project, according to Dr. Hoffmann, is not to "prove" the non-existence of Jesus, but to take the theory as a "testable hypothesis" and use the best methods of critical inquiry to reach a probable conclusion. Additionally, Dr. Hoffmann addresses critics by clarifying the agenda of the project.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Chris Wisnia has been involved with the comics self-publishing for several years. The creator of the celebrated comic books Tabloia, and Doris Danger Seeks Where Giant Monsters Creep, he also recently began a comic book with a decidedly skeptical theme titled Dr. DeBunko, which features a character who investigates and debunks the supernatural and paranormal beliefs in our culture.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Wisnia discusses Dr. DeBunko, the reception the book has garnered in the skeptical community, and what effect he thinks it has (or that he intends it to have) on his readers. He also explores Dr. DeBunko's methods versus other methods of investigating the paranormal, and whether there is reason to be optimistic about the long-term effects of the skeptical movement.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Jennifer Michael Hecht is the author of award-winning books of philosophy, history, and poetry. Her Doubt: A History (HarperCollins, 2003) demonstrates a long, strong history of religious doubt from the origins of written history to the present day, all over the world. Hecht's The End of the Soul: Scientific Modernity, Atheism and Anthropology (Columbia University, 2003), won the Phi Beta Kappa Society's 2004 prestigious Ralph Waldo Emerson Award for scholarly studies that contribute significantly to interpretations of the intellectual and cultural condition of humanity. Hecht's first poetry book, The Next Ancient World won the Poetry Society of America's 2002 Norma Farber First Book Award. Her most recent poetry book, Funny, won the University of Wisconsin's 2005 Felix Pollak Poetry Prize, and Publisher's Weekly called it one of the most original and entertaining books of the year. Her book reviews appear in The New York Times and The Washington Post. Her newest book, The Happiness Myth, has achieved wide critical praise. 

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Hecht discusses the history of the idea of happiness, and various ways that people throughout history have sought happiness. She also explores how people in today's society may sometimes undermine their happiness by the ways they seek it, such as through recreational drug use, consumerism, health and fitness and religion or spirituality. She concludes by talking about how focusing on one's death may be a vital part of living happily in a universe without God.]]></description>

An author, philosopher and an attorney, David's work focuses mostly on the nexus of science, technology, ethics and public policy.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, David explores the relationship between secular humanism and religion, whether secular humanism is just a religion for the nonreligious, the "tenets" of secular humanism, and addresses many challenges to the worldview both from Christian activists and from those in the "atheist movement." He also justifies it as a viable naturalistic life-stance, competitive with supernatural ways of looking at the world.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Matthew C. Nisbet, Ph.D., is a professor in the School of Communication at American University.  His research tracks scientific and environmental controversies, examining the interactions between experts, journalists, and various publics.  In this area, Nisbet has published numerous peer-reviewed studies, with his work having been cited more than 100 times over the past couple years.  In addition to his research, Nisbet co-authored with Chris Mooney the much-talked-about Columbia Journalism Review cover story on intelligent design, and he has written for other popular outlets such as Foreign Policy and Geotimes magazines. He also contributes the semi-regular "Science and the Media" column for Skeptical Inquirer online, and he tracks current events related to strategic communication at his blog Framing Science, which was recently named by the NY Daily News as a "top political blog."

Nisbet is a frequent invited speaker at conferences and meetings across the U.S. and Canada, and he is often called upon for his expert analysis by major news organizations. He holds a Ph.D. in Communication from Cornell University and an A.B. in Government from Dartmouth College. From 1997 to 1999, he worked as Public Relations Director for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry at the Center for Inquiry-Transnational.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Nisbet explores the issue of "framing science" in the public mind, how scientists may be failing at effectively communicating the importance of the implications of science for society, and steps the science community may take to more expertly sell their science to a disinterested public.  He also argues about Richard Dawkins and his effect on the public appreciation of science, and the impact of linking atheism with science for issues such as stem-cell research, teaching evolution in the public schools, and global warming.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Phil Plait works in the physics and astronomy department at Sonoma State University. In the early '90's, he started Badastronomy.com, which has become a popular website focused on educating the public about astronomy and space science, especially as regards common misconceptions and pseudoscientific astronomy claims. In recent years, he has also been involved with debunking several more general pseudoscientific theories. In March 2006, Science magazine celebrated the Bad Astronomy website, praising Plait's blog, begun in March 2005. This blog was also a finalist for the 2006 Weblog Award (the "Bloggie"). The author of one book, The Bad Astronomer, Phil Plait is also a regular contributor to many online publications, including The Huffington Post.

In this interview with D.J. Grothe, Phil Plait discusses science education, the need for the public appreciation of science, public investment in space science, and how such investment benefits society. He also addresses the question of science's compatibility with religion, and explores social conflicts surrounding the teaching of evolution in the public schools.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Tawfik Hamid, an expert on Islamic terrorism, joined the Islamic group Muslim GI in Egypt, while in medical school.  His colleagues in the terror movement included Al Zawaherri, then a friend with whom Tawfik used to pray, and now the number 2 person of Al Qaeda. Eventually Dr. Hamid questioned the feelings of hatred and impulses to violence that his participation in extremist Islam was fomenting within him. He became a physician, and also a scholar of Islamic texts. When he began to preach in Mosques to promote a message of peace instead of violence and hatred, he himself became a target of the Islamic extremists who had previously been his friends. They threatened his life, forcing him and his family to flee Egypt , and then Saudi Arabia . His appearance on Fox TV in early 2006 and his testimony at the first major Intelligence Summit in Washington have further established him as a leading authority on global terror movements. He explains why extremist Islam is far more prevalent and poses a far more serious threat than most Americans appreciate to our economy, ecology, and national security.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, Tawfik Hamid discusses his experiences with extremist Islam and the Al Quada affiliated organization he joined, the question of moderate Islam and moderate Muslim organizations such as the Council on Islamic American Relations. He also explores the dire need for Islam to be reformed, and the recent CFI-sponsored Secular Islam Summit in St. Petersburg, Florida.

Also in this episode, Ibn Warraq reads the Declaration from the Secular Islam Summit, which has received worldwide press and grassroots attention.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Victor Stenger is Emeritus Professor of Physics at the University of Hawaii and Adjunct Professor of Philosophy at the University of Colorado. He is also founder and president of Colorado Citizens for Science. He's held visiting faculty positions at the University of Heidelberg in Germany, and at Oxford in the United Kingdom, and has been a visiting researcher at Rutherford Laboratory in England, the National Nuclear Physics Laboratory in Frascati, Italy, and the University of Florence in Italy. Stenger's search career has spanned the period of great progress in elementary particle physics that ultimately led to the current standard model. He participated in experiments that helped establish the properties of strange particles, quarks, gluons, and neutrinos and has also helped pioneer the emerging fields of very high energy gamma ray and neutrino astronomy. In his last project before retiring, Vic collaborated on the experiment in Japan which showed for the first time that the neutrino has mass. He is the author of many books, including Comprehensible Cosmos, The Unconscious Quantum, Not by Design, Has Science Found God, and the recent New York times best-seller God: The Failed Hypothesis: How Science Shows that God Does Not Exist.

In this talk with D.J. Grothe, Stenger explores many of the topics treated in his book, including the scientific evidence against the belief in God, where the laws of physics come from if not from a divine lawgiver, what E.S.P. research may imply about God's existence, the morality of atheism, and whether science should even be treating the topic of God in the first place. 

Also in this episode, Austin Dacey, director of the Center for Inquiry in New York City details the upcoming Secular Islam Summit in Florida, and the growing grassroots movement of secular muslims working to advance rationalism, science, and the separation of mosque and state in the Islamic world.]]></description>

Grothe, Barbara Forrest examines the intelligent design movement, its history and its agenda, and the so-called "wedge strategy," including the ID movement's public relations efforts and other methods the movement has used to advance the widespread public acceptance of intelligent design. She also talks about the Discovery Institute and the implications of the theory of evolution for theistic belief.]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Peter Singer has been called "the world's most influential living philosopher," by The New Yorker and Time Magazine listed him in "The Time 100,"  their annual listing of the world's 100 most influential people.  One of the most controversial philosophers alive today, he is DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University, and laureate professor at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics, University of Melbourne. He has been recognized as the Australian Humanist of the Year by the Council of Australian Humanist Societies, and is a Humanist Laureate of the International Academy of Humanism.

He writes a regular column for Free Inquiry magazine, and is the author of dozens of books, including Practical Ethics, Rethinking Life and Death, and Animal Liberation, which has sold more than a half million copies, Writings on an Ethical Life, One World: Ethics and Globalization, The President of Good and Evil, about George Bush, and In Defense of Animals. His most recent book, which is written with Jim Mason, is The Way We Eat: Why Our Food Choices Matter.

In this wide-ranging conversation with D.J. Grothe, Peter Singer discusses The Way We Eat and the ethics of vegetarianism, topics in bioethics such as abortion and euthanasia, and what world poverty may demand from citizens in developed nations. He addresses common challenges to his robust system of secular ethics, and explores other implications of utilitarianism. He also considers reasons why people should be moral even if there is no God.]]></description>

He has been a Fulbright Senior Research Scholar and Visiting Fellow at Cambridge University and has lectured widely throughout the world. An expert on the psychology of forgiveness and reconciliation among the world's religions, he is the author of The Seven Deadly Sins: Jewish, Christian, and Classical Reflections on Human Psychology and Wounds Not Healed by Time: The Power of Repentance and Forgiveness, both published by Oxford University Press. His forthcoming book, also to be published by Oxford University Press, is tentatively titled The Tenacity of Unreasonable Beliefs: Jewish Christian and Muslim Scriptural Fundamentalists.

In this discussion with D.J.

      <description><![CDATA[Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of America's leading spokespersons for science. The research areas he focuses on are star formation, exploding stars, dwarf galaxies, and the structure of our own galaxy, the Milky Way. In addition to many scholarly publications, Dr Tyson is one of America's most respected science writers, and he writes a monthly column for Natural History magazine simply titled the "Universe." Among his eight books is his memoir The Sky is Not the Limit: Adventures of an Urban Astrophysicist; and also Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution, co-written with Donald Goldsmith. He is the on-camera host of PBS-NOVA's program ScienceNow, which explore the frontiers of all the science that shapes our understanding of our place in the universe. He is the first occupant of the Frederick P. Rose Directorship of the Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan, where he also teaches.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Dr. Tyson explores the "popularization" of science, the ups and downs of science education, why scientists should be personally motivated to increase public science interest, whether his studies in astrophysics make him more or less religious, the "spirituality" of the scientific outlook, and other topics that he treats in his new book Death By Black Hole.

      <description><![CDATA[Eugene Burger, "universally recognized as perhaps the finest close-up magician in the world," (Stagebill magazine) has written fifteen best-selling books for magicians, starred in a number of instructional videos, lectured widely to magicians' groups in over a dozen countries, and his writings have been translated into several languages. His deep understanding of the psychology and philosophy behind magic has won him international accolades, cover stories in conjuring magazines, and four awards from the famed Magic Castle in Hollywood, California. When the leading international trade journal Magic compiled its list of the one hundred most influential magicians of the twentieth century, Eugene Burger was included for his ability to "arouse feelings of astonishment, as well as a host of other indescribable sensations." His talk, "How Magicians Think," applies his special understanding of deception and perception to the corporate world. He has performed on numerous television shows in Great Britain, Canada, Belgium, Finland and Japan, and has been featured on PBS's The Art of Magic and The Learning Channel's Mysteries of Magic. He's also been been profiled twice on CNN.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Burger discusses belief in the paranormal, "Spirit Theater," and the possible deception of the public by paranormal claimants or entertainers such as Israeli psychic Uri Geller and American psychic medium John Edward. He also explores the relationship of magic to religion and to science, what magic can teach us about how we believe, and the kinds of benefits the student of magic receives from learning the art.]]></description>

In this wide-ranging discussion with D.J. Grothe, Druyan discusses the new book The Varieties of Scientific Experience, her relationship with Carl Sagan, science as an outlook on life, what Sagan called "informed worship," the use of the word "spiritual" by nonreligious people, the humility of science, skepticism about politics and the paranormal, and the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. She also explores the place of humanity in the cosmos, the relationship of science to religion, and whether they are compatible.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Sue Blackmore is a psychologist and writer whose research on consciousness, memes, and the paranormal has been published in over sixty academic papers, as well as book chapters, reviews and popular articles. She regularly writes in the Guardian, and often appears on radio and  television in the United States and the United Kingdom. She spent two decades early in her career investigating psychic phenomena, following an out-of-body experience she had as a student at Oxford. She is the author of a number of books, including Dying to Live (on near-death experiences), In Search of the Light, and Test Your Psychic Powers (with Adam Hart-Davis). The Meme Machine (1999) has been widely acclaimed, and translated into 13 other languages. Her highly praised textbook, Consciousness: An Introduction, and A Very Short Introduction to Consciousness are both published by Oxford University Press, as is her most recent Conversations on Consciousness.

In this far-ranging discussion with D.J. Grothe, Susan Blackmore talks about her research into the paranormal and near death experiences and why she left that field of study, memetics and religion as a meme, free will and the question of moral responsibility, consciousness and the illusory nature of the self, and Zen Buddhism and meditative practice, among other topics. She also explores why is it more important than ever for scientists to speak out about important issues of concern in the world today.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Michelle Goldberg is a freelance writer who has reported from all over the United States, as well as from Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Israel and the West Bank. In her writing, she focuses on the role of ideology in politics, and has reported extensively on both sides of America's intensifying culture wars. In 2002, after a year of traveling and reporting in India and East Asia, Goldberg moved to New York City and took a job as a news and politics reporter with Salon.com, where she covered all aspects of the political right, from the neocons to the theocons.  In addition to Salon, Goldberg's work has appeared in publications including Rolling Stone, The New York Observer, The New Republic online, The Guardian, The UTNE Reader, Newsday and other newspapers nationwide. She was a columnist for the San Francisco Bay Guardian and for Shift Magazine, and has taught at New York University's Graduate School of Journalism. She is a fellow at the Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion, which is one of the organizations here at the Center for Inquiry.

In this discussion with D.J. Grothe, she talks about her acclaimed book Kingdom Coming, and about religious-political extremism in America today and its anti-scientific agenda, the origins of its opposition to gay rights, the use of "secular humanism" as an Religious Right organizing principle, and about the future of "Christian Nationalism." She also talks about the recent midterm elections and the history and effects of the Religious Right in American and world politics.

Also in this episode, Lauren Becker returns to offer some thoughts about Richard Dawkins, J. R. R. Tolkien, and the lure of fiction.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Psychologist Professor Richard Wiseman started his working life as a professional magician and currently holds Britain's only Professorship in the Public Understanding of Psychology at the University of Hertfordshire. He frequently appears in the media, and has written over 60 academic articles and several books, including the best-selling The Luck Factor. Theatre of Science, his new show in collaboration with Dr. Simon Singh, is making its American debut with a run at the Theater for the New City in Manhattan as part of CFI's Science + Art festival, and is sponsored by Skeptical Inquirer magazine. Featuring lie detectors, bolts of lightning, backwards masking, and contortionist Delia Du Sol, this show revives a Victorian tradition in which audiences attended the theatre to see scientific demonstrations as entertainment. Theatre of Science previously played to sold-out audiences and rave reviews at the Soho Theatre, in London's West End.

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Professor Wiseman discusses Theatre of Science, the intersection of science and art, and the role science plays in our society. He also explores strategies that science advocates can use to confront anti-science trends in our society.

Also in this episode, Nathan Bupp explores a humanist answer to the question "Where are we going?"]]></description>

His book, The Republican War on Science is newly out in paperback, completely revised, and was hailed as "a landmark in contemporary political reporting" by Salon.com and a "well-researched, closely argued and amply referenced indictment of the right wing's assault on science and scientists" by Scientific American. 

In this conversation with D.J.

      <description><![CDATA[Harry Houdini, the world-famous magician and escape artist, earnestly explored the religion of spiritualism and communication with the dead after his beloved mother's death in 1913. He eventually crusaded vigorously against those whom he believed were fraudulent mediums, debunking and exposing those whom he argued preyed on the mourning of the grieving. He was renowned for his ability to seem to escape from almost any bonds. As such, he made a pact with his wife Bess, that if anyone could escape the bonds of death, he would. 

In this bonus episode of Point of Inquiry for Halloween night 2006, Joe Nickell, the world's leading paranormal investigator and CSICOP's senior research fellow, and D.J. Grothe (both of whom are former professional magicians) conduct CFI's 10th Annual Houdini Seance. They also explore Houdini's experiences as a "magician among the spirits," recount the ways he challenged the mediums of his day, and discuss his lasting impact on skepticism and society's beliefs about the afterlife.

Also in this bonus episode is an audio clip of the last Houdini Seance of which Bess Houdini was a part. The recording, from Halloween night, 1936, was made at the historic Knickerbocker Hotel in Hollywood.]]></description>

He has won many awards for his fiction, including the Booker Prize. He is best known for The Satanic Verses which provoked violent reaction from the Muslim community and a fatwa by the Ayatollah Khomeini, and was banned in India and througout the Islamic world.

      <description><![CDATA[Jill Tarter holds the Bernard M. Oliver Chair for SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, CA where she also serves as director of the Center for SETI Research. She served as Project Scientist for NASA's SETI program, and has conducted a number of observational programs at radio observatories worldwide. Since funding for NASA's SETI program was cut in 1993, she has served in a leadership role to secure private funding to continue the the exploratory science.  

Her work has brought her wide recognition in the scientific community, including the Lifetime Achievement Award from Women in Aerospace, two Public Service Medals from NASA, and many other awards. She was elected as a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2002 and a California Academy of Sciences Fellow in 2003. In 2004, Time Magazine named her one of the Time 100 most influential people in the world, and in 2005 Tarter was awarded the Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization at Wonderfest, the San Francisco Festival of Science. Tarter is very involved in childhood science education: In addition to her leadership at NASA and SETI Institute, she has spearheaded the creation of two curriculum development projects funded by NSF, NASA, and others. The first, the Life in the Universe series, created 6 science teaching guides for grades 3-9, which were published in the mid nineties. Her second project, Voyages Through Time, is an integrated high school science curriculum on the fundamental theme of evolution in six modules: Cosmic Evolution, Planetary Evolution, Origin of Life, Evolution of Life, Hominid Evolution and Evolution of Technology. 

In this conversation with D.J. Grothe, Jill Tarter discusses the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe, why the search for it is important, the implications for religious belief of such a discovery, recent cuts in science funding, the emerging field of astrobiology, and the need for teaching evolution in the public schools, among other subjects. She also talks about the new Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Universe, which was announced earlier in the week.

Also in this episode, Tom Flynn asks Did You Know? about the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Ann Druyan is a renowned author, lecturer, and television and motion picture writer/producer whose work mostly explores the implications of science and technology for our society. She is the widow of the great Carl Sagan with whom she was a co-writer of the Emmy and Peabody Award winning television series Cosmos. She served as Creative Director for the NASA Voyager Interstellar Record Project that included music and images on the Voyager Spacecrafts that serve as a greeting to possible alien civilizations. She co-created and co-produced of the Oscar nominated movie Contact starring Jodie Foster, which is based on the novel of the same name that she co-wrote with Carl Sagan. She is also the author or co-author of several other books, including A Famous Broken Heart, and Comet, which was on the New York Times best seller list for two months. Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors, also written with Carl Sagan, was another New York Times best seller. Druyan has a new book out in November entitled The Varieties of Scientific Experience: A Personal View of the Search for God, which explores hers and Sagan's views on science and religion. 

Druyan is co-founder and CEO of Cosmos Studios, which produces science-based entertainment across many types of media. Since 2000, Cosmos Studios has produced four documentaries, including "Cosmic Journey" which was nominated for an Emmy for the best nature/science documentary. She is a Fellow of CSICOP at the Center for Inquiry. 

In this discussion with DJ Grothe, she stresses the point that people can have a sense of awe and wonder about the universe without having to believe in God or the supernatural, discusses the work of Carl Sagan and his lasting impact, examines the growing need for scientific literacy in our society, and shares why, despite the current cultural war against science, she is optimistic about the future.

Also in this episode, Carl Sagan's last public address for CSICOP, from its conference in Seattle in 1994, is presented in its entirety. In this keynote, entitled "Wonder and Skepticism," Sagan eloquently conveys prescient insights about the future of science and technology, argues why science is the best way of looking at the world, shares almost prophetic statements about the cultural war against science in America today, passionately calls for tempering skepticism with a humane understanding of why it is so easy in our society to not be skeptical, and encourages the listener to foster such appreciation for this kind of skepticism especially among young people.

And in addition, Lauren Becker shares a moving piece entitled "The Gifts of Carl Sagan."]]></description>

He has been interviewed widely in the media on subjects ranging from alternative medicine and communication with the dead, to the historicity of Jesus. In this discussion with D. J. Grothe, Kurtz talks about the what he calls "creedal fascism," the connection between religion and violence, why it is so vital for humanity's future to critically examine religion, and also recounts his first published fears about Islamic extremism leading to world-wide violence over ten years ago in Free Inquiry. Also in this episode, David Koepsell, executive director of the Council for Secular Humanism, shares "An Open Letter to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld."]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Amy-Jill Levine is E. Rhodes and Leona B. Carpenter Professor of New Testament Studies at Vanderbilt University Divinity School, where she also holds the position of Director of the Carpenter Program in Religion, Gender, and Sexuality. Her many books, articles, and essays address topics like Christian origins, Jewish-Christian relations, and women in the Bible. She has served on the editorial boards of the Journal of Biblical Literature and the Catholic Biblical Quarterly and has held office in the Society of Biblical Literature, the Catholic Biblical Association, and the Association for Jewish Studies. A widely sought-after speaker and favorite at the Chautauqua Institute in upstate New York, she has given hundreds of talks on biblical topics to both academic and nonacademic audiences. She is also a fellow of CSER, the Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion, one of the organizations at the Center for Inquiry. Her awards include grants from the Mellon Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the American Council of Learned Societies. She has a book out in the next few months called The Misunderstood Jew: The Church and the Scandal of the Jewish Jesus.

About this episode: Over 2 billion people worldwide live their lives to one extent or another focused around the man who is central to Christianity, Jesus of Nazareth. Even as skeptics of religion, most listeners to Point of Inquiry will agree that Jesus was one of the most important figures in history, affecting so much of the world we see today: the Christian Church is very influential in politics and society, and fundamental to Christianity is this figure of Jesus of Nazareth; millions of Americans live their lives regularly asking What would Jesus Do?

In this interview with DJ Grothe, Amy-Jill Levine explores the question Who Was Jesus of Nazareth? She also touches on the role old Christianity in American politics and the possible relationship between religion and violence.

Also in this episode, Tom Flynn asks Did You Know about Christiantity in the ancient and modern world, and also discusses the Jesus-cross monument debacle on Mount Soledad in San Diego, California.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Joe Nickell, Senior Research Fellow for CSICOP, is considered the world's leading paranormal investigator. A former professional stage magician and private investigator, he has used his varied background to investigate myths and mysteries, frauds, forgeries, and hoaxes. He has been called "the modern Sherlock Holmes," "the original ghost buster," and "the real-life Scully" (after the character in The X-Files). A veteran of hundreds of TV and radio appearances, he is the author of over 20 books, including Secrets of the Supernatural, Entities, Psychic Sleuths, Real Life X Files, and The UFO Invasion.

In this discussion with DJ Grothe, Joe talks about his recent trip to Peru for CFI's second South American conference, and also about his visit to the world famous Nazca lines, which some people argue is evidence for ancient visits to earth from extra-terrestrials. He recounts his years of investigations into such "geoglyphs," and suggests some alternative scientific theories for their existence.

Also in this episode, Debbie Goddard, a campus organizer with the Center for Inquiry, gives a back-to-school message.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Neil deGrasse Tyson, one of America's superstars of science, focuses his research on star formation, exploding stars, dwarf galaxies, and the structure of our own galaxy, the Milky Way.

In addition to dozens of scholarly publications, Dr. Tyson is one of America's most eloquent and popular science writers. He has a monthly column for Natural History magazine simply titled the "Universe." Among his seven books is his memoir The Sky is Not the Limit: Adventures of an Urban Astrophysicist; and also Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution, co-written with Donald Goldsmith. Origins is the companion book to the PBS-NOVA series of the same title, in which Dr. Tyson serves as the on-camera host. Beginning Fall 2006, he will appear as the on-camera host of PBS-NOVA's program ScienceNow, which will explore the frontiers of all the science that shapes our understanding of our place in the universe.

Dr. Tyson is the recipient of seven honorary doctorates and the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal. His contributions to the public appreciation of the cosmos have been recognized by the International Astronomical Union in their official naming of asteroid "13123 Tyson". On a lighter note, a few years ago he was voted "Sexiest Astrophysicist Alive" by People Magazine.

In this wide-ranging interview with DJ Grothe, Dr. Tyson discusses new developments this week in astronomy which may increase the count of planets in the solar system, reveals why he believes it is likely that there is life elsewhere in the universe, examines Intelligent Design and what he calls "stupid design," eloquently explains how parents may foster an appreciation for science in children, and also discusses science education's real-world economic impact for America.

Also in this episode, DJ and Lauren Becker discuss the new collaborative effort between the Center for Inquiry and the State University of New York called Science and the Public.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Barry Beyerstein is Professor of Psychology and a member of the Brain Behaviour Laboratory at Simon Fraser University. His research has involved many areas related to his primary scholarly interests: brain mechanisms of perception and consciousness and the effects of drugs on the brain and mind. His work in these areas and his interest in the philosophy and history of science have also led him to be skeptical of many occult and New Age claims. This has prompted him to investigate the scientific status of many questionable products in the areas of medical and psychological treatment, as well as a number of dubious self-improvement techniques.

Dr. Beyerstein serves as chair of the Society of B. C. Skeptics and he is a Fellow and a member of the Executive Council of CSICOP and serves on the editorial board of CSICOP's journal, The Skeptical Inquirer.  He was also elected to the Council for Scientific Medicine, another organization headquartered at the Center for Inquiry; it provides critiques of unscientific and fraudulent health products.  He is a founding member of Canadians for Rational Health policy and a Contributing Editor of the journal, The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine.  He has published in these areas himself and is a frequent commentator on such topics on TV and Radio and in the print media.

In this interview with DJ Grothe, Dr. Beyerstein discusses what he calls "the sins of Big Pharma," elaborating on what he considers the negative implications of the profit motive in the pharmaceutical industry and the development of new and unnecessary drugs due to possibly biased research.

Also in this episode, Lauren Becker shares a commentary on secular humanist and skeptic "non-joiners."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Thomas Kida is a professor in the Isenberg School of Management at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and the author of many articles on decision-making. For the last 25 years he has been researching and teaching how we form our beliefs and make decisions.

      <description><![CDATA[James "The Amazing" Randi is a world-renowned magician, skeptic and investigator of paranormal claims. He has been a central figure in the development of the world-wide skeptical movement. He's perhaps most known for the One Million Dollar Challenge, in which his Foundation will award One Million Dollars to anyone who is able to show evidence of any paranormal, supernatural or occult power or event, under test conditions agreed to by both parties. Randi has appeared very widely in the media, including on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show at least 22 times and he's also a regular on Penn and Teller's Showtime Series, BULLSHIT! He has received numerous awards and recognitions, including a MacArthur Genius Grant, a Fellowship from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. In 1989, the American Physical Society presented him with its Forum Award for Promoting Public Understanding of the Relation of Physics to Society. He is the author of many books, notably The Truth About Uri Geller, in which Randi aimed to use his background in magic to investigate the Israeli psychic and performer, and also The Faith Healers, Flim-Flam!, and An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural.

In this discussion with DJ Grothe, Randi discusses critical thinking and magic, recounts his experiences as a leading paranormal investigator investigating people like Peter Popoff and others, shares his views about skepticism and religion, and reflects on the future of the skeptical movement.

Also in this episode, Lauren Becker shares some thoughts about America's Founding and the Fourth of July.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Jerry Coyne is a professor in the department of ecology and evolution at the University of Chicago, where he works on diverse areas of evolutionary genetics. The main focus of his laboratory is on the original problem raised by Darwin - the origin of species - and on understanding this process through the genetic patterns it produces. His writings have appeared in a number of journals, magazines and other publications including Science, Nature, The Guardian and The New Republic. He is the author (with H. Allen Orr) of Speciation and a contributer to the new book Intelligent Thought : Science versus the Intelligent Design Movement.

In this discussion with DJ Grothe, Professor Coyne explores the history, strategy, and motivation behind the modern Intelligent Design movement, and critiques the most widely used ID arguments.

Graduating magna cum laude from UCLA in 1973, he graduated from Loyola Law School of Los Angeles three years later and was admitted to the California Bar that same year. He has chaired the National Legal Committee of Americans United for Separation of Church and State since 1995. He has been the most publicly-active man in the abortion rights movement in California since 1981. He has argued and won before the California Supreme Court and sits as a part-time judge for the Los Angeles County Superior Court system. Since 1990, he has been a member of the First Amendment Committee of the ACLU of Southern California.

In election year 2000, he finished second out of four in a primary for the California State Assembly. He was the only open atheist to be a major contender for a state legislative seat in the United States during that election cycle.
He has successfully represented the scientific outlook and secular humanism in public debates against the leading Christian philosophers around the world. In addition to serving on the Board of the Center for Inquiry and advising the Council for Secular Humanism's First Amendment Task Force, he chairs the Center for Inquiry West, in Hollywood, California.

In this discussion with DJ Grothe, he explores the true meaning of separation of church and state, and defends secularism both for believer and unbeliever alike. 

Also in this episode, Lauren Becker announces Ten Amendments Day, as opposed to Ten Commandments Day, and explains ways listeners can personally get involved advancing public understanding of the Bill of Rights.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Herbert Hauptman is winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for pioneering a mathematical model for determining the molecular structures of crystallized materials. This work has proved to be of the greatest importance because it relates molecular structure to biological activity, and allows for a better understanding of life processes and making possible the development of many new disease-fighting drugs. Dr. Hauptman is president of the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute, research professor in the Department of Biophysical Sciences, and adjunct professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University at Buffalo. Besides the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Dr. Hauptman has received many other honors, including election to the National Academy of Sciences. He is the author of more than 170 publications.

In this discussion with DJ Grothe, Dr. Hauptman discussed the "joy of science," relates the events that led to his winning the Nobel Prize, and elaborates on why science is beautiful.

      <description><![CDATA[The great movie director Orson Welles wrote that Max Maven has "the most creative mind in magic." The New York Times observed that his "category-defying mind-reading veers into conceptual art." The Los Angeles Times stated that his "improvisational skill is enhanced by a charismatic animal magnetism."  He has hosted eight TV specials in Japan (performing in Japanese) and starred in TV series in Taiwan, Sweden, Norway, Finland, England, the United States and Canada. Behind the scenes, Max Maven has been a consultant to the California ScienCenter, numerous universities, and to the magicians David Copperfield, Doug Henning, and Penn & Teller. He has published more than 2,000 articles.

In this passionate and insightful interview, she discusses America's freethought heritage and the Dover intelligent design ruling.

Also in this episode, Tom Flynn presents a new segment called simply, Did You Know? detailing punchy facts about Campus Crusade for Christ, Jimmy Carter and UFO's, and the growth of superstition on American campuses; contributer Lauren Becker shares her personal reflections on her experiences working at a national park in the Bible belt.

A former professional stage magician and private investigator, he taught at the University of Kentucky before joining CSICOP, the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal.

Using his varied background, Nickell has become widely known as an investigator of myths and mysteries, frauds, forgeries, and hoaxes.

He has investigated scores of haunted-house cases, including the Amityville Horror and the Mackenzie House in Toronto, Canada.

A veteran of hundreds of TV and radio appearances, he is the author of over 20 books, including Inquest of the Shroud of Turin, Secrets of the Supernatural, Looking for a Miracle, Entities, Psychic Sleuths, Real Life X Files, The UFO Invasion and the new title Secrets of the Sideshows.

In this interview by DJ Grothe, Joe Nickell cautions the skeptic against debunking, and argues for open-minded investigation of paranormal claims.

Also, in the first of a two part interview entitled The Real War on Christmas, Tom Flynn, editor of Free Inquiry Magazine, urges listeners to wage an actual war on Christmas, in defense of America's religious diversity and the rights of nonbelievers.
