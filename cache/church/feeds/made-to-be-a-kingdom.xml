to Christ’s words in Matthew 16–18 to explore what Scripture reveals about the nature of the
Church. Reading the Gospel through its original biblical and Septuagint context, they reflect on
Christ as the anointed Petra, the gathering of the scattered people of Israel, and the Church as
the place where God restores His flock from among the nations.
Drawing on Micah’s prophecy (2:6-13), the language of gates and mountains, and the Paschal
victory over death, the conversation shows how Orthodox ecclesiology is rooted not in abstract
authority, but in Christ Himself—the Anointed Rock who leads His people through the gates of
hell into life. Along the way, they highlight how Scripture interprets Scripture, why the Church
understands herself as the restored Israel, and how Pascha stands at the heart of what it means
for the Church to be built, gathered, and led by Christ.</description><enclosure length="0" type="audio/mpeg" url="https://media.ancientfaith.com/madetobeakingdom/mbk_2026-02-27.mp3"/><link>https://www.ancientfaith.com/podcasts/madetobeakingdom/built-on-the-anointed-rock-christ-the-church-and-the-gates-of-death/</link><author>Fr.

chrismation, and the Eucharist. Along the way, they clarify Christ’s unique mediation (mesitēs), show

Anthony Perkins and Fr.
Harry Linsenbigler reflect on two passages from In Every Church (p. 78) to clarify how Christ
“fills” every ministry in the Church—from the faithful to readers, deacons, presbyters, and
bishops—without making ordination a ladder of personal holiness. They challenge a common
misreading (including selective appeals to Pseudo-Dionysius) that treats ecclesial rank as a
holiness metric, instead, grounding the Church’s true unity in the liturgy’s confession that “One
is holy” and in the equal reception of Christ in Holy Communion. Finally, they frame clerical
fatherhood as a derivative grace rather than a personal possession, urging vigilance against pride
and despondency, and calling parishes to a shared culture of mutual support so that every
vocation—ordained or lay—can be exercised as service within the royal priesthood of the faithful.</description><enclosure length="0" type="audio/mpeg" url="https://media.ancientfaith.com/madetobeakingdom/mbk_2025-12-18.mp3"/><link>https://www.ancientfaith.com/podcasts/madetobeakingdom/holy-things-for-the-holy-offices-fatherhood-and-the-shared-vocation-of-the-faithful/</link><author>Fr.

The spending of money is a religious action (sacrifice), but very often goes to darker purposes. Giving to the local church should be a part of our tithe, which is money owed to God (tithing or biblical stewardship with a proportion of tithing). Likewise, the local church giving to the diocese is also a basic principle of Orthodox Christianity (1 Cor. 16.1-3). While tithing was a ritual element of the Law of Moses and the priesthood of Aaron, it was also a principle of the Priesthood of Melkizedek (Christ’s priesthood). This includes the priest-husband and priest-wife who do a full tithe (10% of the Priest/Pani income) as an example to the rest of the parish. As Scripture states, giving should not be done "grudgingly", nor mandatorily, but rather freely and cheerfully.

They discuss whether pilgrimages are even necessary, and how some saints emphasized how they are not necessary. In this episode they discuss the beginning of the pilgrimage which began a trip from southern Israel on the coast at the airport up to ancient Galilee (northern Israel). Discussed are the beginnings in the Annunciation and the ministry of Christ that took place in the region that in the Old Testament was called the “Northern Kingdom” (of Israel), and in New Testament was called Galilee.

They explore what it means to be citizens of heaven, how this relates to earthly citizenship, and what “nation” ultimately means for a Christian.

But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. 

They discuss how, in the light of Christ’s coming, we are (and aren't) to understand the term “race.”  Scripture sees all humans as being one race, the human race.  Political shifts cannot affect this truth.  They also talk about how the term “chosen” relates to Christ as the “Chosen one” and the Church as the result of her being engrafted into Him, into His Body.
