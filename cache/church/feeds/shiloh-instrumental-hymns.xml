I had felt the need of a hymn to aid seekers of heart purity while at the altar. I had desired something, simple in expression, true to experience and ending in the full­ess of love. The tune composed by Mr. Fischer, with the first two lines of the chorus, I had seen, and was much pleased with their simplicityy. And as I was sitting in my study one day, the line of thought came rushing into my mind, and I began to write, and in a few minutes the hymn was on paper.”&lt;br/&gt;William McDonald, 1870&lt;br/&gt; It was first sung at aNational Camp­meeting, June 22, 1870. The words were first published in The American Bapt­st Praise Book, 1871.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Music: William G. Fischer, 1870&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.

Long my heart has sighed for Thee; Long has evil dwelt within; Jesus sweetly speaks to me, “I will cleanse you from all sin.&lt;br/&gt;	3.	Here I give my all to Thee— Friends and time and earthly store, Soul and body Thine to be— Wholly Thine forevermore.&lt;br/&gt;	1.
