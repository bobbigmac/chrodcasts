      <title>Copy of Migration: The Bible, Christians, and Migrants with Dr. Danny Carroll R.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Carroll is half-Guatemalan and was raised bilingual and bicultural. In his youth, he spent many summers in Guatemala and later taught at El Seminario Teológico Centroamericano in Guatemala City for thirteen years. The realities of Central America sparked Dr. Carroll's fascination with the Old Testament. The relevance of the biblical text for the challenges of poverty, war, and politics in those developing countries led him to a passionate focus on Old Testament social ethics and the social sciences.</p><p>In addition, his studies in English literature and literary theory have generated an ongoing engagement with literary approaches to the Old Testament and critical studies. Experiences in this country and abroad have led him to a deep appreciation for the unique contributions that ethnic minorities, women, and the global church make to the interpretation of the Old Testament. Before coming to Wheaton, Dr. Carroll taught Old Testament at Denver Seminary for many years and founded a Spanish-language lay training program there. At Wheaton, he hopes to model a commitment to connecting careful biblical scholarship with the mission of the church as it engages today’s complex realities. Dr. Carroll has been involved in Hispanic churches and teaching on the Bible and immigration for many years. His research focuses on the prophetic literature and Old Testament social ethics. He has just completed a major commentary on the book of Amos.</p>

      <title>Immigration Reprise: Julie Raymon of the AJC</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Julie Rayman, Senior Director of Policy and Political Affairs of the American Jewish Committee helps us understand how Jews relate through their history to migrants and immigrants, and what this means today. 

Since January 2012, Julie Rayman, Senior Director of Policy and Political Affairs, has served as the lead legislative advocate for AJC’s policy priorities. On behalf of AJC, she has supported the launch of congressional caucuses such as the Bipartisan Taskforce for Antisemitism, the Congressional Caucus on Black-Jewish Relations, and the Congressional Hellenic-Israel Alliance. Regularly on Capitol Hill to advocate for AJC priority legislation, she has helped position AJC as a thought and policy leader in combating global antisemitism and hate, promoting Israel’s place in the world, promoting pluralism, and advocating for strong, principled American global leadership. In addition to spearheading AJC’s outreach on Capitol Hill, Rayman also fulfills a variety of senior political liaison responsibilities for AJC, engaging with candidates and elected officials, crafting and promulgating policy position papers and Party platform suggestions, and spearheading AJC’s events on the sidelines of the Republican and Democratic National Conventions. 

Before coming to AJC, she was senior advisor to Congressman Heath Shuler, covering foreign policy, human rights, defense, and homeland security. Rayman holds a B.A. from American University as well as a Master’s from the National Defense University in Strategic Security Studies, with a concentration in counterterrorism. She also holds an M.A. from Georgetown University in Religious Studies.

      <title>AI Spiritual Direction with Bruce Tallman</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Path to Spiritual Growth and Enlightenment</strong></p><p>In the digital age where distractions are at every turn, the journey towards spiritual growth and enlightenment has never been more crucial. Spiritual direction, a sacred practice that has its roots in ancient traditions, offers a beacon of light to those seeking inner peace, purpose, and connection. This transformative process allows individuals to delve deep into their spiritual core, guided by a seasoned spiritual director or mentor. Whether you're exploring the realms of mindfulness, seeking solace through meditation, or are on the path of self-discovery with practices like yoga, the guidance of a spiritual director can offer invaluable insights and direction. The ultimate aim? To align with one's true self, foster a profound connection with the universe, and lead a life of meaning and purpose.</p><p><strong>Harnessing the Power of Spiritual Direction in Modern Times</strong></p><p>In a world dominated by search engines and keywords, the quest for authentic spiritual content can be overwhelming. However, when you infuse your search with terms like "spiritual direction," "inner peace techniques," "guidance for soulful living," or "deepening spiritual practice," you unlock a treasure trove of wisdom waiting to be explored. For the spiritually inclined, the benefits of such a journey are manifold: improved mental well-being, a deeper sense of belonging, clarity of purpose, and an elevated consciousness. By harnessing the power of spiritual direction, one is not only enriched personally but also contributes to raising the collective consciousness, making the world a more harmonious place. It's about tapping into that age-old wisdom while leveraging the tools of modern times, including Artificial Intelligence if used with integrity. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Path to Spiritual Growth and Enlightenment</strong></p><p>In the digital age where distractions are at every turn, the journey towards spiritual growth and enlightenment has never been more crucial. Spiritual direction, a sacred practice that has its roots in ancient traditions, offers a beacon of light to those seeking inner peace, purpose, and connection. This transformative process allows individuals to delve deep into their spiritual core, guided by a seasoned spiritual director or mentor. Whether you're exploring the realms of mindfulness, seeking solace through meditation, or are on the path of self-discovery with practices like yoga, the guidance of a spiritual director can offer invaluable insights and direction. The ultimate aim? To align with one's true self, foster a profound connection with the universe, and lead a life of meaning and purpose.</p><p><strong>Harnessing the Power of Spiritual Direction in Modern Times</strong></p><p>In a world dominated by search engines and keywords, the quest for authentic spiritual content can be overwhelming. However, when you infuse your search with terms like "spiritual direction," "inner peace techniques," "guidance for soulful living," or "deepening spiritual practice," you unlock a treasure trove of wisdom waiting to be explored. For the spiritually inclined, the benefits of such a journey are manifold: improved mental well-being, a deeper sense of belonging, clarity of purpose, and an elevated consciousness. By harnessing the power of spiritual direction, one is not only enriched personally but also contributes to raising the collective consciousness, making the world a more harmonious place. It's about tapping into that age-old wisdom while leveraging the tools of modern times, including Artificial Intelligence if used with integrity. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Rabbi Bemporad is the director of the nonprofit Center for Interreligious Understanding (CIU), which he founded in 1992. Its aim is to bring people of all religious faiths together to promote open dialogue, mutual respect, and theological understanding of the common foundations shared by the world’s religions. Rabbi Jack Bemporad began teaching at Vatican universities in 1998 and has been Director of the John Paul II Center and Professor of Interreligious Studies, both at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum), in Rome since 2009. Concurrently, he also serves as Rabbi of Congregation Micah of New Jersey, in Cresskill.</p><p>Fleeing the fascist takeover in Italy prior to WWII, Bemporad and his family traveled to the U.S. when he was five years old. Thus, having personally suffered as the result of persecution and prejudice, he has dedicated his career to improving relations among Christians, Muslims, and Jews worldwide. The Rabbi is recognized internationally for his diplomatic skill and leadership in matters of religious understanding and reconciliation. He is one of the rare Jewish leaders to have had a personal audience with Pope John XXIII, numerous personal audiences with Pope John Paul II, and was one of three rabbis to have blessed him shortly before his death. Most recently, he met with Pope Francis at the conclusion of the “Refugees and Migrants” conference, co-sponsored by the CIU in Rome this past November.</p><p>Rabbi Bemporad is the author of numerous books and articles, including Our Age: The Historic New Era of Christian-Jewish Understanding, published by New City Press.

      <title>The Future of Religion: Dr. Bob Roberts of GlobalNet and the Challenge to Love</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Growing up as a Baptist pastor’s kid in a small town in East Texas, Bob got the chance to learn the Bible at a young age. He developed strong theological opinions, but didn’t know how to live it outside the church. He knew how to debate his faith, but didn’t know how to love.</p><p>After marrying his high school sweetheart Niki, Bob, who initially felt that he was going to be a global missionary, felt a calling to plant <a href="http://www.northwoodchurch.org/">Northwood Church</a> in Keller (Dallas/Fort Worth), Texas. During the early days in his church ministry, two questions radically impacted his life: ‘When will Jesus be enough?’ & ‘What if the church were the missionary?’.</p><p>Drawing inspiration from early church history and the emerging church in the developing world, Bob envisioned a new way of engaging the local church to achieve common goals. He calls for building a church culture rather than a church program. Glocal (Local + Global) churches that make disciples who, transformed by the Holy Spirit, are infiltrating today’s culture on a global and local scale. He believes that instead of just paying a few people to do the mission work for your church, your entire church needs to be mobilized to use their job and skills to live on mission both in your city and around the world.</p><p>As he began to build friendships around the world, he realized he had so much to learn! He is conservative in theology but realized the problem is not what he believed or what Jesus said; it is how we live that out. His theology didn’t change; his methodology did. Faith in the public square is where theological conviction doesn’t put you in opposition with other people.</p><p>Ever since, Bob has been a trailblazer in the peacemaking and international religious freedom arenas. He is frequently called upon by the U.S. Department of State, United Nations, U.S. Islamic World Forum, World Economic Forum, ambassadors, international royal families, diplomats, policy leaders, and others for his groundbreaking work in this field. He seeks to build and execute a model whereby multi-faith and church planting combine to create flourishing cities. Bob has had the honor of engaging in bridge-building efforts in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Israel, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Egypt, West Bank, Iraq, Kuwait, Iran, Mexico, Brazil, Australia, and others.</p><p>Dr. Bob Roberts, Jr. is the founder of <a href="http://www.glocal.net/">GlocalNet</a>, a non-profit dedicated to mobilizing the church for transformation in the public square, founder and chairman of <a href="http://glocalventures.org/">Glocal Ventures Inc (GVI)</a> and co-founder of <a href="http://www.mfnnetwork.com/">Multi-Faith Neighbors Network</a> (MFNN), a multifaith organization committed to creating international religious freedom through intentional cross-cultural relationships. He is also currently the Senior Global Pastor at <a href="http://www.northwoodchurch.org/">Northwood Church</a> and host of the <a href="https://bobrobertsjr.com/podcast/">Bold Love podcast</a>.<br /><br />Bob has <a href="https://bobrobertsjr.com/resources">contributed or been featured</a> on the World Economic Forum, Fox Business Channel, Washington Post, New York Times, <i>Huckabee</i> Show, Religious News Service, C-Span, Templeton Religions Trust, El-Hibri, Christianity Today, Outreach Magazine and more.</p><p>Bob is a graduate of Fuller Theological Seminary (Doctorate of Ministry), Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (Masters of Divinity), and Baylor University (BA). He and his wife Niki have two children and three grandchildren.</p>

He believes that instead of just paying a few people to do the mission work for your church, your entire church needs to be mobilized to use their job and skills to live on mission both in your city and around the world.</p><p>As he began to build friendships around the world, he realized he had so much to learn! He is conservative in theology but realized the problem is not what he believed or what Jesus said; it is how we live that out. His theology didn’t change; his methodology did. Faith in the public square is where theological conviction doesn’t put you in opposition with other people.</p><p>Ever since, Bob has been a trailblazer in the peacemaking and international religious freedom arenas. He is frequently called upon by the U.S. Department of State, United Nations, U.S. Islamic World Forum, World Economic Forum, ambassadors, international royal families, diplomats, policy leaders, and others for his groundbreaking work in this field. He seeks to build and execute a model whereby multi-faith and church planting combine to create flourishing cities. Bob has had the honor of engaging in bridge-building efforts in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Israel, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Egypt, West Bank, Iraq, Kuwait, Iran, Mexico, Brazil, Australia, and others.</p><p>Dr. Bob Roberts, Jr. is the founder of <a href="http://www.glocal.net/">GlocalNet</a>, a non-profit dedicated to mobilizing the church for transformation in the public square, founder and chairman of <a href="http://glocalventures.org/">Glocal Ventures Inc (GVI)</a> and co-founder of <a href="http://www.mfnnetwork.com/">Multi-Faith Neighbors Network</a> (MFNN), a multifaith organization committed to creating international religious freedom through intentional cross-cultural relationships. He is also currently the Senior Global Pastor at <a href="http://www.northwoodchurch.org/">Northwood Church</a> and host of the <a href="https://bobrobertsjr.com/podcast/">Bold Love podcast</a>.<br /><br />Bob has <a href="https://bobrobertsjr.com/resources">contributed or been featured</a> on the World Economic Forum, Fox Business Channel, Washington Post, New York Times, <i>Huckabee</i> Show, Religious News Service, C-Span, Templeton Religions Trust, El-Hibri, Christianity Today, Outreach Magazine and more.</p><p>Bob is a graduate of Fuller Theological Seminary (Doctorate of Ministry), Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (Masters of Divinity), and Baylor University (BA).

      <title>Migration: The Bible, Christians, and Migrants with Dr. Danny Carroll R.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Carroll is half-Guatemalan and was raised bilingual and bicultural. In his youth, he spent many summers in Guatemala and later taught at El Seminario Teológico Centroamericano in Guatemala City for thirteen years. The realities of Central America sparked Dr. Carroll's fascination with the Old Testament. The relevance of the biblical text for the challenges of poverty, war, and politics in those developing countries led him to a passionate focus on Old Testament social ethics and the social sciences.</p><p>In addition, his studies in English literature and literary theory have generated an ongoing engagement with literary approaches to the Old Testament and critical studies. Experiences in this country and abroad have led him to a deep appreciation for the unique contributions that ethnic minorities, women, and the global church make to the interpretation of the Old Testament. Before coming to Wheaton, Dr. Carroll taught Old Testament at Denver Seminary for many years and founded a Spanish-language lay training program there. At Wheaton, he hopes to model a commitment to connecting careful biblical scholarship with the mission of the church as it engages today’s complex realities. Dr. Carroll has been involved in Hispanic churches and teaching on the Bible and immigration for many years. His research focuses on the prophetic literature and Old Testament social ethics. He has just completed a major commentary on the book of Amos.</p>

      <title>Migration: Julie Raymon of the AJC, Jewish Understandings of Migrants and Migration</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Julie Rayman, Senior Director of Policy and Political Affairs of the American Jewish Committee helps us understand how Jews relate through their history to migrants and immigrants, and what this means today. 

Since January 2012, Julie Rayman, Senior Director of Policy and Political Affairs, has served as the lead legislative advocate for AJC’s policy priorities. On behalf of AJC, she has supported the launch of congressional caucuses such as the Bipartisan Taskforce for Antisemitism, the Congressional Caucus on Black-Jewish Relations, and the Congressional Hellenic-Israel Alliance. Regularly on Capitol Hill to advocate for AJC priority legislation, she has helped position AJC as a thought and policy leader in combating global antisemitism and hate, promoting Israel’s place in the world, promoting pluralism, and advocating for strong, principled American global leadership.

Before coming to AJC, she was senior advisor to Congressman Heath Shuler, covering foreign policy, human rights, defense, and homeland security. Rayman holds a B.A. from American University as well as a Master’s from the National Defense University in Strategic Security Studies, with a concentration in counterterrorism.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>“For nearly 75 years, Americans United has consistently shown up in the public square ready to protect America’s constitutional guarantee of church-state separation that ensures religious freedom for all of us,” said Dr. Dent. “For me, this is especially important when we recall the dark and complicated history of a nation that has often overlooked the human rights of racial and religious minorities. I am excited to build relationships with AU’s longtime friends and to develop new interfaith partnerships in support of advocating for social justice, human dignity and freedom for all.”</p>
