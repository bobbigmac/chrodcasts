<blockquote><p>Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil.<br />
<strong>Matthew 4:1</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>In Harm&#8217;s Way</h3>
<p>There are people who are willing to put themselves in harm&#8217;s way. These people recognize the serious nature of their commitment and understand the potential consequences. They are ready to make the ultimate sacrifice for the safety and security of others.</p>
<p>There is a special debt of gratitude these people deserve—military personnel, firefighters, members of law enforcement, and emergency medical technicians. Without their willingness to serve and readiness to sacrifice everything, our lives would be much more difficult. The same can be said about Jesus, and the debt of gratitude we owe him.</p>
<p>When we read Matthew&#8217;s account of Jesus&#8217; temptation, we might wonder, &#8220;Why would the Holy Spirit lead Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil? Why would he put Jesus into harm&#8217;s way?&#8221; The answer has everything to do with our rescue from sin and freedom from the controlling power of the devil.</p>
<p>Because we are sinners from birth, it is impossible for us to defeat the devil. So great is his power over us that we would always succumb to his attacks. It is because of our weakness that God the Father had his Son come to this earth, take on flesh and blood, and become our substitute. This meant Jesus had to live under all of God&#8217;s righteousness requirements. It also meant Jesus had to put himself into harm’s way.</p>
<p>To free us from the devil&#8217;s control, Jesus had to subject himself to temptation. Every cunning act, every lie and deception, every powerful ploy, Jesus undertook on our behalf. What was impossible, Jesus accomplished perfectly and without sin. He overcame the devil&#8217;s attacks and secured complete victory. He now offers us the ability to live a self-controlled, upright, and godly life.</p>
<p>We can be at peace with God through our Savior&#8217;s perfect obedience. We are safe and secure because Jesus put himself into harm&#8217;s way to rescue us.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Prayer:</h4>
<p>O blessed Jesus, you are my refuge, my strength, and my never-failing help. Daily be with me to protect and bless me through your victory over the devil. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Genesis 3:15</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Who Will Win?</h3>
<p>Right in the middle of the wreckage, God speaks a promise. Adam and Eve have disobeyed. Trust is broken. Shame has entered the world. Everything good now feels fragile. And before the humans say a word—before they apologize, explain, or promise to do better—God talks to the serpent, &#8220;He will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a strange moment. God isn&#8217;t giving instructions. He&#8217;s declaring an outcome. This isn&#8217;t advice. It&#8217;s a verdict. Evil will not win.</p>
<p>That promise matters because, if we’re honest, it often feels like evil is winning. Sin feels strong. Guilt lingers. Death feels permanent. We see brokenness in the world and in ourselves, and we wonder if it’s too deep to fix. We wonder if what’s broken can really be made right. God’s promise answers that question. Yes. And not because people improve, but because God intervenes.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, God makes it clear that rescue will come from outside us. An offspring. A deliverer. Someone who will step into the fight we&#8217;re losing and win it for us. That promise runs like a thread through the entire Bible and leads directly to Jesus.</p>
<p>When Jesus is nailed to the cross, it looks like the serpent has won. Jesus suffers. Jesus bleeds. Jesus dies. It looks final. But the cross is not defeat—it&#8217;s the decisive blow. Sin is paid for. God&#8217;s justice is satisfied. Satan&#8217;s accusation is silenced.</p>
<p>And Jesus&#8217; resurrection confirms it. The serpent struck Jesus&#8217; heel, but Jesus crushed the serpent&#8217;s head. Death did its worst and still lost. That victory changes everything. It means your sin, real as it is, is not stronger than God&#8217;s grace. Your past, heavy as it may feel, does not define your future. Fear and guilt do not get the last word. Jesus does.</p>
<p>Paradise was lost in a garden, but it was promised on a cross and procured at an empty tomb. God keeps his promises—even when everything seems broken. God&#8217;s answer is always bigger than our questions.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Prayer:</h4>
<p>Lord God, thank you for keeping your promise to defeat sin, death, and the devil. When I feel overwhelmed by guilt or fear, remind me of Christ&#8217;s victory. Give me faith to trust in what Jesus has done for me and peace to live in the hope he has won. Amen.</p></blockquote>

We see brokenness in the world and in ourselves, and we wonder if it’s too deep to fix. We wonder if what’s broken can really be made right. God’s promise answers that question. Yes. And not because people improve, but because God intervenes. From the very beginning, God makes it clear that rescue will come from outside us. An offspring. A deliverer. Someone who will step into the fight we&amp;#8217;re losing and win it for us. That promise runs like a thread through the entire Bible and leads directly to Jesus. When Jesus is nailed to the cross, it looks like the serpent has won. Jesus suffers. Jesus bleeds. Jesus dies. It looks final. But the cross is not defeat—it&amp;#8217;s the decisive blow. Sin is paid for. God&amp;#8217;s justice is satisfied. Satan&amp;#8217;s accusation is silenced. And Jesus&amp;#8217; resurrection confirms it. The serpent struck Jesus&amp;#8217; heel, but Jesus crushed the serpent&amp;#8217;s head. Death did its worst and still lost. That victory changes everything. It means your sin, real as it is, is not stronger than God&amp;#8217;s grace. Your past, heavy as it may feel, does not define your future. Fear and guilt do not get the last word. Jesus does. Paradise was lost in a garden, but it was promised on a cross and procured at an empty tomb. God keeps his promises—even when everything seems broken. God&amp;#8217;s answer is always bigger than our questions. Prayer: Lord God, thank you for keeping your promise to defeat sin, death, and the devil. When I feel overwhelmed by guilt or fear, remind me of Christ&amp;#8217;s victory. Give me faith to trust in what Jesus has done for me and peace to live in the hope he has won. Amen. &amp;nbsp; Daily Devotions is brought to you by WELS. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License.

<blockquote><p>Then the L<span style="font-size: small;">ORD</span> God said to the woman, &#8220;What is this you have done?&#8221; The woman said, &#8220;The serpent deceived me, and I ate.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Genesis 3:13</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>What Is This You Have Done?</h3>
<p>This question forces us to slow down and face reality. Sin isn&#8217;t just a mistake. It has consequences. It breaks trust. It damages relationships. It ripples outward in ways we don&#8217;t expect.</p>
<p>Adam blamed Eve. Eve blamed the serpent. We’re not very different. We blame circumstances, upbringing, stress, or other people—anything to avoid the weight of responsibility. But excuses don&#8217;t heal what&#8217;s broken.</p>
<p>God&#8217;s question isn&#8217;t meant to crush. It&#8217;s meant to confront. Because healing can&#8217;t happen without honesty. The Bible doesn&#8217;t minimize sin. But it also doesn&#8217;t leave us stuck in it. God names the problem so he can address it. And before humans ever ask for forgiveness, God promises a solution.</p>
<p>That’s the heart of the Christian message: God takes sin seriously—and he takes sinners seriously too. Instead of demanding that we fix ourselves, God steps in to do what we can&#8217;t. Jesus takes the consequences of sin on himself. The cross is where God&#8217;s justice and love meet.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t answer this question by pointing fingers. We answer it by looking to Jesus and saying, &#8220;Lord, have mercy.&#8221; And God does.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Prayer:</h4>
<p>Lord, I admit that my sin has caused real damage. I confess that I often try to excuse myself instead of turning to you. Thank you for loving me enough to confront me—and for forgiving me through Jesus. Help me live in the freedom of your grace. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?&#8221;<br />
<strong>Genesis 3:11</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Who Told You That?</h3>
<p>Before sin, Adam and Eve had nothing to hide. After sin, they were suddenly aware of their flaws. Shame entered the picture, and with it came a new voice telling them, you are not enough.</p>
<p>God&#8217;s question exposes something important: shame doesn&#8217;t come from God. God didn&#8217;t tell them they were worthless, broken, or beyond hope. Sin did that. The lies did that.</p>
<p>Those same voices are still loud today. You&#8217;re not good enough. You&#8217;ve failed too badly. If people really knew you, they wouldn&#8217;t accept you. God couldn&#8217;t love someone like you.<br />
God asks, &#8220;Who told you that?&#8221;</p>
<p>The world defines us by success, appearance, and performance. Our own hearts replay regrets and failures. But God defines us differently. He sees sinners worth saving. He sees broken people worth dying for. The truth is, we are more flawed than we want to admit—but more loved than we ever imagined. Jesus didn&#8217;t come for people who had it all together. He came for people weighed down by shame. On the cross, Jesus took not just our sins, but our disgrace. He was mocked, rejected, and exposed so that we could be covered with forgiveness.</p>
<p>When God looks at those who trust in Jesus, he doesn&#8217;t see shame. He sees his beloved children.</p>
<p>So when the voices rise—when shame tries to tell you who you are—listen instead to the God who asks, &#8220;Who told you that?&#8221; Then hear what he tells you instead: You are forgiven. You are loved. You are mine.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Prayer:</h4>
<p>Father, I confess that I listen to voices of shame instead of your truth. Forgive me for believing lies about myself and about you. Thank you for Jesus, who removes my guilt and gives me a new identity. Help me believe what you say about me. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the L<span style="font-size: small;">ORD</span> God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the L<span style="font-size: small;">ORD</span> God among the trees of the garden. But the L<span style="font-size: small;">ORD</span> God called to the man, &#8220;Where are you?&#8221;<br />
<strong>Genesis 3:8-9</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Where Are You?</h3>
<p>God knew exactly where Adam and Eve were. He knew they were hiding. He knew why they were afraid. So why ask the question? Because this wasn&#8217;t a question of location. It was a question of relationship.</p>
<p>After sin entered the world, the first human instinct wasn&#8217;t confession—it was hiding. Shame does that. Guilt convinces us that if God really knew us, he wouldn&#8217;t want us. So, we hide behind excuses, distractions, or even religion. We stay busy. We avoid quiet moments. We tell ourselves we&#8217;ll deal with God later.</p>
<p>But God doesn&#8217;t wait for sinners to come looking for him. He comes looking for them. &#8220;Where are you?&#8221; isn&#8217;t an angry shout. It&#8217;s a grieving invitation. God is saying, &#8220;Why are you hiding from the one who loves you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sin separates us from God, not because God stops loving us, but because fear replaces trust. That separation is something we can&#8217;t fix on our own. We can&#8217;t hide well enough, behave well enough, or promise to do better enough to restore what&#8217;s broken.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why God steps into our hiding place himself. In Jesus, God enters a world full of shame, fear, and brokenness. Jesus takes our guilt onto himself at the cross. He dies exposed, so we don&#8217;t have to hide anymore. He rises so that fear doesn&#8217;t get the final word. Christianity isn&#8217;t about working your way back to God. It&#8217;s about realizing God already came to you.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever felt distant from God—because of regret, doubt, or failure—this question is for you: &#8220;Where are you?&#8221; Not to condemn you. But to bring you home.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Prayer:</h4>
<p>God, I admit that I often hide from you when I&#8217;m afraid or ashamed. Thank you for seeking me instead of abandoning me. Thank you for Jesus, who removes my guilt and invites me back into your presence. Help me trust your grace and stop hiding. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the L<span style="font-size: small;">ORD</span> God had made. He said to the woman, &#8220;Did God really say, &#8216;You must not eat from any tree in the garden&#8217;?&#8221;<br />
<strong>Genesis 3:1</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Did God Really Say?</h3>
<p>The question sounds innocent enough. Almost helpful. &#8220;Did God really say…?&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t sound like rebellion. It sounds like curiosity. Like someone double-checking the fine print. That&#8217;s how temptation often works. Rather than kicking the door down. It knocks politely.</p>
<p>The serpent doesn&#8217;t start by denying God. He starts by reframing God. He takes something God said clearly and bends it just enough to make God seem unreasonable. Restrictive. Suspicious. Suddenly, the problem isn&#8217;t disobedience—it&#8217;s whether God can be trusted at all.</p>
<p>That question still works today. &#8220;Did God really say that… about sex? About money? About forgiveness?&#8221; &#8220;Would a loving God really care?&#8221; &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a little outdated?” The doubt sounds modern and thoughtful. But underneath it is the same old lie: God might not be as good as he says he is.</p>
<p>And if we’re honest, we&#8217;ve listened. We&#8217;ve assumed we know better. We&#8217;ve trusted our instincts more than God&#8217;s Word. And the result hasn&#8217;t been freedom. It&#8217;s been guilt, broken relationships, and a quiet sense that something isn&#8217;t right. That&#8217;s what sin does. It promises more and delivers less.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s striking is what God does next. He doesn&#8217;t disappear. He doesn&#8217;t give up on humanity because they doubted him. Instead, he keeps speaking. He keeps acting. He keeps moving toward the people who just moved away from him. The entire Bible is God answering the serpent&#8217;s question. And the clearest answer is Jesus.</p>
<p>Jesus shows us what God is really like. He doesn&#8217;t withhold good—he gives himself. He doesn&#8217;t manipulate—he sacrifices. At the cross, God proves once and for all that he is not holding out on us. He’s giving everything to rescue us. So, when you hear that question—Did God really say? —listen closely to God&#8217;s answer. The answer is, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He really does say, &#8220;You can trust me.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Prayer:</h4>
<p>Lord God, I confess how easily I doubt your Word and goodness. Forgive me for trusting myself more than you. Thank you for showing me your heart through Jesus. Help me trust what you say and rest in what you have done for me. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The tempter came to [Jesus] and said, &#8220;If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.&#8221; Jesus answered, &#8220;It is written: &#8216;Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'&#8221;<br />
<strong>Matthew 4:2-4</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Temptations</h3>
<p>We don&#8217;t know how many temptations the devil flung at Jesus in the wilderness. But both Matthew and Luke record three.</p>
<p>First, we see the devil picking up exactly where he left off with Adam. Even the three temptations that are mentioned are echoes of the way the devil had once tempted Eve: &#8220;The woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food&#8221; (Genesis 3:6). Now the devil pricks at Jesus&#8217; need for food by tempting him to command &#8220;stones to become bread.&#8221; Perhaps Jesus&#8217; hunger was the most obvious weak spot to begin with. But rather than listen to his stomach, Jesus listened to God&#8217;s Word. And although Jesus is truly God, he didn&#8217;t speak a new Word. He simply used what had already been written through Moses, &#8220;Man does not live by bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the L<span style="font-size: small;">ORD</span>&#8221; (Deuteronomy 8:3).</p>
<p>Food isn&#8217;t the only important thing we need, nor should it be at top of the list. A person who starves but who has faith in Jesus will live forever. But a person with a full stomach and no faith will die in eternal torment. When we focus on God through his Word, God promises to bless us. Few of us know someone who is genuinely starving for food. Do you know people who are starving for the Word?</p>
<p>Feed them!</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Prayer:</h4>
<p>Lord God, increase my spiritual appetite for your Word and satisfy my hunger with its promises and blessings. Help me see opportunities to share the bounty of your Word with others that many more may be fed and filled with the abundance of its truth. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<h3>God invites Us to His Dinner Party</h3>
<p>Imagine that you&#8217;ve been invited to a dinner party. The menu has things that you enjoy. Also, the time and the date work for you. But then you come to realize that you don’t know anyone else who&#8217;s been invited to the party, and you have absolutely nothing in common with the people who are going. Would you still be as excited to go? I&#8217;d guess most of us wouldn&#8217;t be as excited. After all, what really makes a party fun is being with people we know and enjoy.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a dinner party with God? It&#8217;s hard to imagine! And at first glance, it&#8217;s probably a scary thought. After all, God is perfect, holy, and eternal; we&#8217;re sinners. What in the world do we have in common with God, or he with us?</p>
<p>And yet God chooses to invite us to his dinner party. God chooses to socialize with us. We read in today&#8217;s Bible verses of how he allowed the leaders and elders of Israel to dine in his presence. What an experience! He did it in an even more wondrous measure when Jesus came to this world and lived our human life. He continues to do it today, promising that he&#8217;s with us always, to the very end of time. And he&#8217;s preparing a place for us at the eternal &#8220;banquet feast&#8221; in heaven.</p>
<p>But why would God want ME at his party? I&#8217;m a sinner!</p>
<p>Ah, true. But Jesus lived, died, and rose, thereby paying for your sins in full. And so, you&#8217;re a welcome guest through Jesus. What a wonderful party it will be!</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Prayer:</h4>
<p>Savior Jesus, thank you for inviting me to the party, the eternal party. Fill me with longing for the day you take me there. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, &#8220;This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.&#8221; We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain.<br />
<strong>2 Peter 1:16-18</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Faith Rooted in Fact</h3>
<p>People sometimes speak about Christianity as if it&#8217;s a comforting legend. It&#8217;s nice, meaningful, and inspiring, but not necessarily true. Like a story you tell children at bedtime. Or like something people invented long ago to explain life and ease fear.</p>
<p>But Peter wouldn&#8217;t let anyone talk that way about Jesus. He says clearly: &#8220;We did not follow cleverly devised stories.&#8221; In other words, &#8220;This wasn’t a made-up tale. We weren&#8217;t passing along rumors or religious myths. We were there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter and the disciples personally saw Jesus&#8217; glory on the mountain. They heard the voice from heaven declare: &#8220;This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.&#8221; That moment wasn&#8217;t imagination or metaphor. It happened in real time, in real history, before real eyewitnesses.</p>
<p>And Peter was willing to stake everything on it. He didn&#8217;t benefit from telling that story. He wasn&#8217;t paid or celebrated. He was opposed, imprisoned, beaten, and eventually killed for proclaiming what he had seen and heard.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what makes the Christian faith so different from mere &#8220;belief systems.&#8221; Christianity doesn&#8217;t begin with people reaching up to God through feelings or philosophy. It begins with God stepping down into our world so that we could know him in truth.</p>
<p>So, when guilt weighs on your heart, or suffering raises questions, or doubt whispers that it&#8217;s all too good to be true, remember this: your faith rests on something that happened. Not clever stories, but eyewitness truth. And the Jesus they saw is the same Jesus who still reigns in power and still calls you his own.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Prayer:</h4>
<p>Lord Jesus, thank you that my faith is grounded in truth, not imagination. Strengthen my heart with your Word and help me trust what you have done for me. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, &#8220;This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!&#8221;<br />
<strong>Matthew 17:5</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Listen to Him</h3>
<p>Peter was talking. He was excited. He was making plans. He was telling Jesus what he thought should happen next. And then God interrupted him.</p>
<p>Matthew says, &#8220;While he was still speaking…&#8221; Before Peter could finish, God the Father spoke from a bright cloud: &#8220;This is my Son, whom I love… Listen to him!&#8221;</p>
<p>We need that interruption, too, because we&#8217;re good at talking. Good at planning. Good at deciding what we think God should do. But God doesn&#8217;t tell you to listen to yourself. He tells you to listen to Jesus.</p>
<p>I met with someone recently who told me he hadn’t been to church in a long time. Then he added, &#8220;But it&#8217;s okay. I pray twice a day.&#8221; I told him I was glad he prays. That&#8217;s a good thing. But then I asked him a question he hadn&#8217;t considered: &#8220;When do you make time to listen to Jesus?&#8221; Because prayer is talking to God. But God&#8217;s Word is how God talks to you.</p>
<p>Listen when life is going well. Listen when it isn&#8217;t. Listen when you&#8217;re calm. Listen when you&#8217;re anxious. Listen when you don&#8217;t know what to do because Jesus doesn&#8217;t just give advice. He gives promises.</p>
<p>He says you are forgiven and that God is with you. He says death won&#8217;t win, and eternal life is yours.</p>
<p>So, if you feel pulled in ten directions today, start here: Listen to him.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Prayer:</h4>
<p>Father, quiet my heart and my mind. Help me listen to Jesus and trust his promises, especially when life is hard. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified.  But Jesus came and touched them. &#8220;Get up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Matthew 17:6-7</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Ashes and Hope</h3>
<p>Today, the season called Lent begins. Lent is the forty-day journey leading up to Easter. It&#8217;s a season when Christians slow down and focus on why Jesus came. We examine why he suffered, why he died, and why he rose again.</p>
<p>Lent starts with a day called Ash Wednesday. Ash Wednesday reminds us of something we don&#8217;t like to think about. That we are dust. And to dust we will return. That sounds grim. And it is. But it&#8217;s also honest.</p>
<p>Jesus&#8217; three disciples had an honest moment, too. When they heard God&#8217;s voice on the mountain, they fell facedown, terrified. They couldn&#8217;t handle it. And then Matthew gives us one of the most comforting sentences in the Bible: &#8220;But Jesus came and touched them.&#8221; Jesus didn’t stay far away. He didn’t wait for them to get brave. He came close. And he said, &#8220;Get up. Don&#8217;t be afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what Lent is about. It&#8217;s not about you proving yourself to God. It&#8217;s about Jesus coming close to you. </p>
<p>And then Jesus did something even bigger. He came down from the mountain because he had another hill to climb. A cross to carry. He went there for sinners. For weak people. For dust-people like us.</p>
<p>Ash Wednesday reminds you that you will die. But Jesus reminds you he died and rose again for you. So, the ashes aren&#8217;t the end of your story. Jesus is.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Prayer:</h4>
<p>Lord Jesus, on this Ash Wednesday, remind me that I am dust, but I am not forgotten. You came close, you carried my sin, and you defeated death. Give me hope in your unfailing promises. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Peter said to Jesus, &#8220;Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Matthew 17:4</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Jesus Is with You</h3>
<p>Movie previews can be dangerous. You go to the theater for a film, but then the previews start. And one of them looks so good you find yourself thinking, &#8220;Wait… why am I here for this movie? I want that one!&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a little like what happened to Peter on the mountain. Jesus&#8217; face shone like the sun. His clothes were bright as light. Moses and Elijah appeared. It was a glimpse of glory—a preview of heaven.</p>
<p>So, Peter said, &#8220;It is good for us to be here.&#8221; He even offered to build shelters so they could stay. But Peter wanted the glory without the suffering. He wanted Jesus shining and without the cross.</p>
<p>And honestly, don’t we?</p>
<p>We love the part of faith that feels uplifting. Peace. Joy. Hope. Blessings. But when life gets heavy, when grief comes, when fear rises, when our prayers don’t seem answered, then we start longing for a quick escape. We want mountaintop moments. We want out of the valley. We want the preview to become the whole story.</p>
<p>But Jesus didn&#8217;t stay on the mountain. He came down. Because the glory Peter saw could only be ours if Jesus first went to the cross. And he did for you.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the comfort: when Jesus came down, he didn&#8217;t come down away from his disciples. He came down with them. Into the crowds. Into the mess. Into the hard days. Into the valley.</p>
<p>So, if life feels low right now, don&#8217;t assume Jesus is far. The Savior who shines with glory is the same Savior who walks beside you in pain. He has not left you. He knows the valley. And he will bring you through it.</p>
<p>The preview, heaven, is coming for all those who put their faith in Jesus as their Savior. And right now, Jesus walks with you in the middle of real life because he came down the mountain.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Prayer:</h4>
<p>Lord Jesus, when I want comfort without struggle, remind me that you came down the mountain and went to the cross for me. Give me strength to follow you, trusting your love. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<strong>Matthew 17:2</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Who Is Jesus?</h3>
<p>People have lots of opinions about Jesus. Some say he was just a good teacher. Some say he was just a prophet. Some say he was just a symbol of love and justice. Some say he was just a legend.</p>
<p>But what Jesus reveals and tells us about himself doesn&#8217;t leave any room for &#8220;just.&#8221; The apostle Matthew tells us that Jesus was &#8220;transfigured.&#8221; That means he changed right in front of his disciples. For a moment, his glory showed through. He shone like the sun. His clothes became dazzling white. And God the Father spoke from a cloud: &#8220;This is my Son.&#8221;</p>
<p>That means Jesus isn&#8217;t simply an inspirational leader. He is God&#8217;s Son. And that changes everything.</p>
<p>Maybe you need that reminder today. It&#8217;s easy for doubts to creep in. Life gets messy. Suffering makes you wonder if God is really there. And sometimes Jesus can feel far away. That&#8217;s why this moment matters. God didn&#8217;t just want the disciples to hope Jesus was the Savior. He wanted to show them so they would know with certainty.</p>
<p>Since Jesus is God&#8217;s Son, his words carry authority. His promises carry weight. His death is not a tragedy; it&#8217;s a rescue. His resurrection isn&#8217;t a myth; it’s the doorway to eternal life.</p>
<p>And that is why Jesus matters for you right now. Because Jesus is God&#8217;s Son, your life is not an accident. Your sins are not too big for forgiveness. Your pain is not ignored. And your future is not hopeless.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to wonder if God loves you. God sent his Son for you. The Transfiguration shines a spotlight on who Jesus really is. And when you see him clearly, you can finally see your life clearly too.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Prayer:</h4>
<p>Lord Jesus, help me see you for who you truly are, God&#8217;s Son and my Savior. Give me confidence in your promises today. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.<br />
<strong>Matthew 17:1-2</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Jesus Alone is Your Savior</h3>
<p>It was late summer, a little more than half a year until Jesus&#8217; crucifixion. We don&#8217;t know exactly what mountain this was, but since Jesus and his disciples had just been near Caesarea Philippi on the slopes of Mount Hermon, it is likely that this was the Mountain of the Transfiguration.</p>
<p>Jesus took three of his disciples up the mountain with him. These three were his inner circle of friends who were privileged to witness an amazing scene—Jesus was transfigured before them. The appearance of his face and clothing changed. For a brief time, those three disciples saw the unveiled divine glory of Jesus, the bright glory that is his from eternity as the Son of God.</p>
<p>In a few short months, these same disciples would witness the deepest point of Jesus&#8217; humiliation on earth—his bitter suffering and death on a cross. The vision of Jesus&#8217; divine glory on that mountain helped prepare the disciples for what they would see their friend go through at the hands of his enemies. The transfiguration of Jesus assured them that he is the Son of God whom God the Father appointed and sent to earth to be the world&#8217;s Savior from sin.</p>
<p>With that firm conviction, Peter later preached, &#8220;Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved&#8221; (Acts 4:12). Jesus is the Son of God. Jesus alone is the world&#8217;s Savior—your Savior!</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Prayer:</h4>
<p>Jesus, glorified on the Mount of Transfiguration as the eternal Son of God, you went on to deeply humble yourself as my Savior on Calvary’s mountain and die to take away the punishment for my sins. Lead me to always honor you as my Lord God and love you as my only Savior. Amen.</p></blockquote>
