<p>There is in all of us a selfishness, a lack of self-control, a dysfunction. And yet God calls us to, “be ye holy.” Being holy does not just mean to keep the rules. Being holy means you are wholly reoriented in your thinking, in your feeling, and in your behavior. It means to be totally changed in mind, heart, and will. To be holy is to wholly belong to God.</p>
<p>Let’s look at these verses in 1 Peter and ask 1) what does this text tell us a holy person looks like? And 2) how can we want a holy life so that we get it?</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 7, 1993. Series: Splendor in the Furnace: 1 Peter, Part 1. Scripture: 1 Peter 1:13-21.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>To be a holy person is not what people popularly think it is these days. In modern English we often use the word “holy” to mean “holier than thou”—inaccessible, condescending, and self-righteous. Or at best, people will think of a holy person as somebody who keeps all the rules. </p>
<p>But holiness is not about keeping all the rules. Holiness is an attitude of the heart in which you look at God and you say, “Use me.” Therefore, to be holy means more than just to give him your mind; you have to give him your life. In 1 Peter 1, there is a contrast shown between a life without God and a holy life. And this contrast shows us a depiction of a holy life.</p>
<p>These verses show us that 1) a life without God is ignorant, but a life of holiness integrates the thought and the life, 2) a life without God is an imitative life, but a holy life is an examined life, and 3) a life without God is a life of slavery without authority, but a holy life is a life of freedom under authority.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 31, 1993. Series: Splendor in the Furnace: 1 Peter, Part 1. Scripture: 1 Peter 1:13-16.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Many Western people today think that Christianity is for people who don’t want to use their minds, that if you’re educated and thoughtful you wouldn’t believe. They think that to be Christian you’d have to jettison your thoughts and surrender to a realm of feeling, to a leap of faith.</p>
<p>But the Bible tells us the opposite. In 1 Peter, when it calls us to holiness, it says we must prepare our minds. Holiness includes the whole person—including the mind. In fact what Peter says and what it says all through the Bible is not only “May Christians think,” but “Christians must think.” It’s fundamental.</p>
<p>Let’s look at how 1 Peter shows us that 1) Christianity requires you to use your mind, to be thinking and rational, and 2) Christianity is the only thing that really encourages thinking and gives a basis for it.</p>

But the Bible tells us the opposite. In 1 Peter, when it calls us to holiness, it says we must prepare our minds. Holiness includes the whole person—including the mind. In fact what Peter says and what it says all through the Bible is not only “May Christians think,” but “Christians must think.” It’s fundamental.
Let’s look at how 1 Peter shows us that 1) Christianity requires you to use your mind, to be thinking and rational, and 2) Christianity is the only thing that really encourages thinking and gives a basis for it.
This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 24, 1993. Series: Splendor in the Furnace: 1 Peter, Part 1. Scripture: 1 Peter 1:13-16.

<p>In these verses, Peter says to “gird up the loins of your mind.” It’s a picturesque statement of preparing for action, of tucking your robes into your belt. And Peter applies this to the mind, meaning you have to focus totally and get ready for action. Seeking God is not a hobby.</p>
<p>But it’s not just about seeking God. What you need is in verse 16: “Be ye holy; for I am holy.” This teaches us three things: 1) it teaches us that God is holy, 2) it teaches us that we must be holy, and 3) it teaches us that we can be holy because God is holy.</p>

<p>The Buddhists look at suffering as an illusion. Western secular culture looks at suffering as a curse. But Christianity looks at it as something both extremely real and far more hopeful. Our Savior, Jesus Christ, came to glory through suffering. And when you see what he went through for you, then and only then have you got a framework and a power to get through your own suffering.</p>
<p>In 1 Peter 1 it teaches us that 1) you’ll never be able to face suffering without knowing a lot of biblical doctrine, 2) Christians do experience grief and troubles of life, and 3) when suffering comes into your life, God hates the brokenness but uses it to teach you things he wants you to learn.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>When Paul was in prison, facing and expecting death, he had the audacity to say, “I have found the secret of being content no matter the circumstances.” </p>
<p>The amazing thing is that in the Bible this is not some kind of high nirvana that only certain people can find. In fact, the Bible doesn’t just say this is possible—it actually says this is commanded. The tenth commandment is “Thou shalt not covet.” Coveting is that inner grasping after things that says, “I have to have these things or I’m so empty.” But until you recognize you’re incapable of contentment, you are incapable of contentment. </p>
<p>Paul doesn’t leave us grasping after the secret. He outlines it for us, and shows us 1) why we need it, 2) what it is, and 3) how to get it.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 28, 1990. Series: Ten Commandments 1989. Scripture: Philippians 4:10-13.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Honesty is a difficult commodity. It’s pretty hard to find. Instead, you can see dishonesty everywhere: in the high places in the professional places, and all the way down to the inner places. We’re not honest with other people, and we’re not even honest with ourselves.</p>
<p>Dishonesty starts because we’re all so good at denial. All around you there are people who, through blame-shifting and rationalization, are absolutely blind to a fault that others around them can see clearly. No wonder the Bible says honesty is a supernatural work of God. Honesty starts when you say, “I’m incapable of it.” Until then, you haven’t even begun to have integrity.</p>
<p>Psalm 15 and 16 will show you yourself. This passage shows us 1) the opposite of integrity, 2) the counterfeit of integrity, and 3) how to cultivate integrity.</p>

If the money you have was yours and you’re not generous with it, you’re just being stingy; but if the money is somebody else’s and you’re not generous with it as the owner directs, it’s robbery.</p>
<p>The Bible says your attitude toward your wealth and your possessions is not an incidental or peripheral or optional issue. It’s at the very heart of what it is to be a Christian. A Christian says the money you have is yours to enjoy and take care of as a trustee, but you must give it generously as God directs.</p>
<p>James 2 says real faith inevitably leads to three characteristics: 1) it’s radically generous, 2) it’s radically gracious, and 3) it’s radically practical.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 14, 1990. Series: Ten Commandments 1989. Scripture: James 2:1-17.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Money is not a silly or superfluous thing. Money was designed to be our dignity. It answers to something God put down deep in us: that we all need to have part of the world to care for, and without any part of the world to care for, we have no dignity. But what has happened in most of our lives is instead of being our dignity, money has become our definition. </p>
<p>Money is power. It can act destructively or constructively in your life. How can you be sure it’s acting constructively? You know the answer: it’s in the Bible many places. It’s not how much money you have or how little money you have, it all depends on your heart attitude. You have to be freed from money as your definition so that it can become your dignity and you can release its power where it will do the most good.</p>
<p>There are three principles that need to be worked down into your heart, and we see them in what Paul says in 2 Corinthians: 1) God owns everything you have, so you have to act like a trustee, 2) Jesus gave everything for you, so you’re freed for radical generosity, and 3) you can take it with you if you invest it in eternal things.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 7, 1990. Series: Ten Commandments 1989. Scripture: 2 Corinthians 8:1-15.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>When Christianity burst onto the scene, the early Romans were amazed and astounded in two particulars: that Christians were radically generous, giving away large portions of income, and that Christians were radically pure, believing in no sex outside of marriage. This unique understanding transformed the Roman world.</p>
<p>At that time, there were two major philosophies about sex. The first was the platonic view: that the soul is good, the body is bad, and sex is kind of dirty. The second was the mystery religions’ view: that sex is an appetite that is unhealthy to repress. The prudes and the pagans. And in 1 Corinthians, Paul vividly and incisively shows that Christians are neither. Instead, Christians have the most glorious and lofty possible understanding of sex that there is.</p>
<p>Let’s look at what this passage shows us about 1) how God says sex is supposed to function in a life, and 2) in looking at how to order our lives in accord to that, we see two things: 3) the only real cure for loneliness is the thing that sex points to, and 4) when you misuse sex, it works backwards.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on December 10, 1989. Series: Ten Commandments 1989. Scripture: 1 Corinthians 6:15-7:5.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Jesus gives us the most radical ethic of love that’s ever been put forth: “Turn the other cheek.” This ethic has been criticized and disregarded, but no one ever says the reason is because it’s too low or vile or unworthy. They always say it’s too high, too lofty.</p>
<p>The reason it seems so lofty is it’s a whole new dimension. The love ethic in Matthew 5 is part of a package. The package is that Christianity itself is actually an interconnected set of radically altered relationships. A new relationship with God creates a new relationship with yourself, creates a new relationship with others. They can’t be separated. They rise and fall together, and you can’t have one without the others. </p>
<p>Let’s take a look at those three aspects. As we move through this passage, we’ll see 1) the understanding of the self, 2) the relationship with others, and 3) the root of it all: a new relationship with God.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on December 3, 1989. Series: Ten Commandments 1989. Scripture: Matthew 5:21-24; 38-48.</p>

In Genesis 9, at the end of the flood, God assures Noah and his family of this truth. He says that if a person takes the life of any other human, he will hold that person accountable.</p>
<p>This passage is meant to get everybody to feel the weight of your neighbor’s glory, to feel the weight of the value God has invested in every human being. If you really let this passage have its effect, you will come out saying to yourself, “I cannot ignore people the way I do. I have to treat people seriously. I have to honor them. I have to be aggressively compassionate.”</p>
<p>Let’s see how this passage makes a case for us to be a compassionate people. The case is 1) every human being is made in the image of God, and 2) every human being is held accountable for that image.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 25, 1989. Series: Ten Commandments 1989. Scripture: Genesis 9:1-7.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>What gets God angry? Romans 1 tells us: ingratitude. If there’s a God who created you, do you work for his goals or do you take all that he’s given you and live for your own interests? My friends, that is ingratitude of the highest order, and this passage says it is secret treason. </p>
<p>The reason this is a secret treason is because you keep it secret from yourself. Romans 1 says even though we know deep down that there is a God who created us, we all suppress that truth to some degree. We know we’re committing treason, but we keep it secret even from ourselves. We know it and we don’t know it. </p>
<p>This passage looks at the structure of this secret treason: it says 1) ingratitude leads to repression, 2) repression leads to darkness, and 3) darkness leads to all of the problems in your life.</p>

Yet in all of the Ten Commandments, there’s no place that talks about how people should relate to the government or to the people above them. It doesn’t talk about authority except right here. 
So let’s look a little bit deeper and ask the commandment three questions: 1) what does this commandment tell us to do? 2) why should we do it? and 3) how can we do it?
This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 12, 1989. Series: Ten Commandments 1989. Scripture: Ephesians 6:1-4.

<p>Scientists will tell you the thing that restores the body is not the length of your sleep—it’s the depth. In the same way, the Bible shows that there are all kinds of shallow ways you can get rid of tension, but none of those are the deep rest that really restores the soul.</p>

<p>God in his grace seeks to liberate us—with the most liberating of all of the Ten Commandments: “I am the Lord thy God … thou shalt have no other gods before me.” What he’s saying there is, “I’m the only God there is; all others are imposters.

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>The book of Deuteronomy is a series of sermons Moses preached just before he died. In it, he lays out, in the most comprehensive and practical way, how you should live if you experience the grace and salvation of God. If you experience God, how should that actually affect the way in which you live your life? It’s a very, very practical book and an incredibly comprehensive book.</p>
<p>Today, we get to the Ten Commandments. This is one of the most influential texts in the entire history of the world. Let’s take a look and see what we’re taught about it. It’s awfully basic, but it’s awfully basic because it’s awfully important.</p>
<p>There are four things we’re going to learn here about God’s Law: 1) the origin of the Law; 2) the substance of the Law; 3) the problem of the Law, and 4) the solution to that problem.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on May 27, 2007. Series: Deuteronomy – Doing Justice, Preaching Grace. Scripture: Deuteronomy 5:6-21, 24-29.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Jesus says, “Don’t be anxious,” three times in this passage. Quick question that comes up: how does anybody have the audacity to command us to not be anxious? Nobody gets up in the morning and says, “I’m going to really be anxious today. I can’t wait.” It’s not a very voluntary thing.</p>
<p>So why would Jesus command us? If we look carefully, we’ll see that he’s not commanding us in a drill sergeant way. Instead, he gets underneath and he explains and he reasons with us. There’s a sense in which he does surgery. He’s saying, “If you let me do my surgery in you, if you listen to my instructions, I can get anxiety out of you. I can deal with your anxiety.”</p>
<p>Let’s look at what Jesus shows us about 1) what is anxiety? 2) where does it come from? and 3) what do we do about it?</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on June 3, 1990. Series: The Lord’s Prayer 1990. Scripture: Matthew 6:25-34.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>To many people, the whole point of prayer is this: how do you get God to give you what you need? Now, that’s not the point of prayer, and if you think it is, you will get very little. That’s the irony. Prayer is very effective for those people who don’t come into it hoping it will primarily be a way to get God to give you things.</p>
<p>In the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus shows us that after you are done centering your heart and mind on the fatherhood of God and submitting to his lordship by saying, “your will be done,” then you can go and start asking him for your daily bread, for protection, for provision.</p>
<p>So there’s an order here that must be honored, or else you rip up the fabric of prayer. Let’s look at what it means to pray with this order: 1) first accepting “your will be done,” and 2) then asking.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on May 27, 1990. Series: The Lord’s Prayer 1990. Scripture: Matthew 6:9-15.</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[To many people, the whole point of prayer is this: how do you get God to give you what you need? Now, that’s not the point of prayer, and if you think it is, you will get very little. That’s the irony. Prayer is very effective for those people who don’t come into it hoping it will primarily be a way to get God to give you things.
In the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus shows us that after you are done centering your heart and mind on the fatherhood of God and submitting to his lordship by saying, “your will be done,” then you can go and start asking him for your daily bread, for protection, for provision.
So there’s an order here that must be honored, or else you rip up the fabric of prayer. Let’s look at what it means to pray with this order: 1) first accepting “your will be done,” and 2) then asking.

<p>We’re going to look now at the part of the prayer that’s about admitting. Let me reiterate that since prayer essentially is centering on God, everything starts with adoration and everything has to be understood as flowing out of it. If your repentance, if your admitting doesn’t flow out of adoration, it won’t deal with your guilt and it will even make it worse. But if it flows out of adoration of the Father, it can get rid of your guilt.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, in the context of the Lord’s Prayer, teaches us 1) the reason for repentance, 2) the motivation for repentance, and 3) three ways to repent.</p>

<p>But I’d like us to think about the fact that Christmas doesn’t change our lives like it ought to. John says the Word of God became a flesh and blood human being. This is a life-transforming truth. </p>
<p>Let’s look at three ways this truth should change our lives. If Christmas happened, and it did, 1) we have infinite comfort in the face of suffering, 2) we have infinite powerful conviction and incentive to serve, and 3) we have a hope that is both realistic and infallible.</p>

This text gives us three things: 1) it gives us a warning about suffering, 2) it gives us three resources for suffering, and 3) it tells us how we can be sure those resources will work.
This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on December 10, 2006. Series: In Christ Jesus: How the Spirit Transforms Us. Scripture: Romans 8:13-27.

<p>When I began to understand the teaching of these chapters, my life began to change. In this brief series, I’m sharing these teachings with you as we ask this question: how does faith in Christ actually lead to real change in one’s life?</p>
<p>In Romans 8, we see that in Jesus, you get three things: 1) you get the freedom to know yourself, 2) you get a new method to change yourself, and 3) you get a new power to be yourself.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on December 3, 2006. Series: In Christ Jesus: How the Spirit Transforms Us. Scripture: Romans 8:1-13.</p>

<p>The gospel is unique to all the religions of the world in that it says salvation is not achieved, but is received. So if you understand the gospel, and that salvation has nothing to do with how you live, why would you change? In Romans, Paul answers that, and in the process, he shows how faith in Christ concretely leads to changes.</p>
<p>In Romans 6, Paul gives us three keys to real, profound life change: 1) you have to recognize the shape of your spiritual slavery, 2) you have to realize the scope of your cosmic unity with Jesus, and 3) you have to live daily out of your new identity.</p>

<p>In Luke 14, we see two things: 1) Jesus Christ lays out a standard for sacrificial giving that’s so astonishing it will seem unreasonable, and 2) Jesus actually shows how reasonable this kind of giving is.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve seen the pendulum in the church swing to extreme places over spiritual gifts—sometimes giving obsessive focus to them, and sometimes ignoring them.</p>
<p>There’s nothing more practical for helping us avoid extremes and understand what a Christian church should actually look like than to embrace what the Bible gives us here, a theology of spiritual gifts.</p>
<p>Let’s ask three questions of this text: 1) what are spiritual gifts, 2) what are the practical implications for church life, and 3) how can we rightly use spiritual gifts?</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on August 29, 2010. Series: The Holy Spirit. Scripture: Ephesians 4:1-13.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>We’re looking at what the Bible teaches about the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>My impression is there are an awful lot of churches in the world that talk about nothing but spiritual experience, and there are an awful lot of churches that are absolutely afraid of the subject and talk only about truth and knowing the right things. I think the remedy for that imbalance is the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, because the deeper you get into it, the more you realize Spirit and truth go together.</p>
<p>Let’s look now at what John 14 tells us about 1) who the Holy Spirit is, 2) what the Holy Spirit does, and 3) how you can receive what he gives.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on July 4, 2010. Series: The Holy Spirit. Scripture: John 14:16-26.</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Contemporary people stare at the biblical concept of humility the way a cow stares at a new gate. 
The approach of our culture is expressive individualism, and it completely flies in the face of what the Bible says about the importance of humility. So let’s look in Philippians 2 at this concept of humility. 
This magnificent passage tells us about 1) a sickness we have, 2) what we would look like if we were healthy, and 3) how to get the cure.
This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on May 23, 2010. Series: The Real Signs of the Spirit. Scripture: Philippians 2:1-11.

<p>Americans’ trust of their institutions—business, government, church—is at an all-time low. All the studies show that. There’s a sense that there has been a failure of integrity in our society at all levels. Therefore, what does the Bible have to say about this all-important subject? </p>
<p>Ephesians 4 shows us 1) there’s a problem of practicing truthfulness, 2) there’s a problem of abusing people with the truth, and 3) how we solve both problems. </p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on May 16, 2010. Series: The Real Signs of the Spirit. Scripture: Ephesians 4:15-16; 25-30.</p>

<p>What it’s saying is that patience is the trait by which you are able to bear up under difficulty without giving up or giving in to bitterness. There are two kinds of patience: there’s patience under difficult circumstances and there’s patience with people. And Romans 12 is a remarkable passage about how to be patient and gracious to people who are opposing you. </p>
<p>This passage gives us 1) a principle of showing patience, 2) some ideas on how to practice it, and 3) how to get the power to do it.</p>

<p>If you squeeze a rubber ball and then take your hand away, it snaps right back to where it was. You restrained the rubber ball temporarily, but you didn’t really change it. Almost all of us have that rubber ball experience. We try to change parts of our lives, and we put a lot of willpower behind it. Then as soon as circumstances change, it snaps right back.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 13 tells us that a supernaturally changed heart 1) is not the same as a busy life in service of others, 2) is not the same as a morally committed life, but 3) is meeting love as a power and as a person. </p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on April 11, 2010. Series: The Real Signs of the Spirit. Scripture: 1 Corinthians 13:1-13.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>We’ve lost connection with part of what the Bible teaches about sin: that God gets angry at sin. And I’m here to tell you that losing that is a bad thing.</p>
<p>In fact, I’ll go this far: you need an angry God. If you don’t believe in an angry God, a really angry God who hates sin and is going to punish it, you’re impoverishing yourself. You’re taking away all sorts of hope and humility and love.</p>
<p>Isaiah 64 and 65 show us 1) God’s anger is not like our anger usually is, 2) you need an angry God if you’re going to live in hope, 3) you need an angry God if you’re going to live in humility, and 4) you need an angry God if you’re going to understand how loved you are.</p>

Two questions kept coming up: what’s wrong with us that we’re capable of this, and what are we going to do about it? </p>
<p>Isaiah 52 to 53 was written to answer those same two questions. It was written to a nation facing exile, to people who were about to face captivity, atrocities, and prison. And it has maybe the most well-known answer in the Bible to the question about human evil: God is sending somebody, the servant of the Lord.</p>
<p>In this passage, we learn 1) who he is, 2) why he came, and 3) what he did.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on February 28, 1999. Series: What’s Really Wrong with the World. Scripture: Isaiah 52:13-53:12.</p>

In our society, we’ve been taught that words like “sin” or “evil” are oppressive or meaningless. Yet we sense something out there that we don’t have the vocabulary for.</p>
<p>But the Bible gives us a far richer vocabulary and helps us understand sin in far more nuanced ways. In Jeremiah 2, there’s a prophesy from Jeremiah to a nation in spiritual decline. And in it, we’ll see how sin is replacing God, and the result is addiction of spirit.</p>
<p>Jeremiah’s telling us about 1) the dynamics of spiritual attraction, 2) the dynamics of spiritual addiction, and 3) the dynamics of spiritual restoration.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on February 14, 1999. Series: What’s Really Wrong with the World. Scripture: Jeremiah 2:1-8.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>The story in Judges 17 is not interesting. It’s a bunch of trivial people doing kind of dumb, weird things. Micah robs his mother, but then he gives the money back. Then his mother cheats God. Then Micah hires a Levite, and then Danites hire the Levite instead. What’s the point? </p>
<p>On the one hand, this is terrible storytelling. Why was this incident chosen out of this whole period of history? There’s nobody in this narrative who you care about. They’re shallow and uninteresting. And we’re left completely unprepared for what happens in the following chapters, where there’s rape and civil war and genocide. So why is this here?</p>
<p>Every other part of Judges is about God’s salvation. And this passage shows us what we look like without his salvation. In other words, this shows us the nature of sin, and it shows us some things that are very surprising. This tells us 1) what sin does to us, 2) what sin does to God, and 3) how we can be cured of it. </p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on February 7, 1999. Series: What’s Really Wrong with the World. Scripture: Judges 17:1-13.</p>

<p>Esau and Jacob were twins, and Esau was the oldest. When their father is fooled into giving Jacob the birthright, Esau can’t get ahold of his anger.

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>The rich young ruler looked like he had it made. He’s characterized by moral excellence and he’s financially wealthy. He’s got it so together that he even admits he doesn’t have it all together—that there’s still something he lacks. He isn’t sure what it is. He’s gotten to the top and realized, “I’ve almost made it.” </p>
<p>So he comes to Jesus and says, “I just need that one more step.” And Jesus gives him an outrageous, strong answer. Jesus tells him he’s on a completely wrong road—that he’s totally outside the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Unless we understand why the rich young ruler went away from Jesus grieved, we might be in danger of also being sent away. The rich young ruler went away grieving because 1) he talked to the real Jesus, 2) Jesus smashed two of his basic assumptions about how religion works, 3) Jesus got personal, and 4) he didn’t understand treasure in heaven.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on March 19, 1995. Series: The Seven Deadly Sins. Scripture: Matthew 19:16-25.</p>

So he comes to Jesus and says, “I just need that one more step.” And Jesus gives him an outrageous, strong answer. Jesus tells him he’s on a completely wrong road—that he’s totally outside the kingdom of God.
Unless we understand why the rich young ruler went away from Jesus grieved, we might be in danger of also being sent away. The rich young ruler went away grieving because 1) he talked to the real Jesus, 2) Jesus smashed two of his basic assumptions about how religion works, 3) Jesus got personal, and 4) he didn’t understand treasure in heaven.
This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on March 19, 1995. Series: The Seven Deadly Sins. Scripture: Matthew 19:16-25.

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Joseph’s career was going along fairly well. He’d risen from servanthood to becoming, in a sense, the Chief Operating Officer of a huge estate. And then sex came. He wasn’t even looking for it, but it came at him.</p>
<p>Things may be going very well for you, but sex will come—and it’s such a powerful force that how you handle it can make or break you. From Genesis 39, we can learn about what we’re going to call lust. We learn something from what we see Potiphar’s wife doing, we learn something from what we see Joseph doing, and we learn from what we see God doing. </p>
<p>Let’s look at 1) how to understand lust, 2) how to handle it, and 3) how to heal it.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on March 12, 1995. Series: The Seven Deadly Sins. Scripture: Genesis 39:4-21.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>In the Middle Ages, theologians said there are different forms of gluttony—that you can eat and drink excessively, sumptuously, daintily, or impulsively. Technically, gluttony means to eat and drink immoderately. But gluttony also tells us something about each of us.</p>
<p>Gluttony is taking something good and then cramming it in until we’re sick of it. Our desires are disordered so that good and necessary things become cravings. Sin, in other words, makes us all addicted to something. We all crave something, and we do it in such a way that it is very, very bad for us.</p>
<p>Let’s look at three things this Scripture teaches us about craving: 1) the depth of our craving, 2) the structure of our craving, and 3) the healing.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on March 5, 1995. Series: The Seven Deadly Sins. Scripture: Joshua 7:19-26, Hosea 2:13-15.</p>

<p>For the last hundred years, the reigning Western understanding of why we are so cruel and unhappy has been that it comes from outside of us, that it comes from conditions. But in the last few decades, the intelligentsia have increasingly admitted there’s something deeper than that. The Bible says the problem with human beings is not environmental—that there is a poison in us that’s called sin. And we need to understand the symptoms of that poisoning, the symptoms of sin.</p>
<p>Let’s look today at 1) the symptom of envy, 2) the root cause, and 3) the antidote.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>After he broke his promise to Jesus, Peter wept bitterly. Peter was an absolutely broken man in the profoundest possible way, and yet within weeks he was poised as the leader of a new movement, about to become one of the most influential leaders in the history of the world.</p>
<p>What broke Peter like this, and then what restored him so quickly? The answer is the same: promises. Promises are the reason he was broken, and promises are the reason he was restored. And the case of Peter tells us more about the power of commitments than, I think, any other incident in the Scripture.</p>
<p>Let’s look at what Peter learned: 1) how promises make us, and 2) how we can make promises.</p>

He’d built maybe the most incredible city in history. He was at the pinnacle of power, and his life fell apart anyway. And here’s the incredible part: he’s glad it happened! He praises God for having done it.</p>
<p>Do you know why? Because he says, “There was a spiritual cancer in me. There was something in me that was so bad, it was so dangerous, it had poisoned my soul so deeply that even as drastic as the treatment was, it was worth it to get it out of my soul.” What was it? Pride. Spiritual pride.</p>
<p>Could it be that we need to know the same lesson he learned? This text teaches us four things: it tells us about 1) the sleep of pride, 2) the heart of pride, 3) the outcome of pride, and 4) the healing of pride.</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[In sixth century B.C., Nebuchadnezzar was the absolute monarch of the Babylonian empire. He’d built maybe the most incredible city in history. He was at the pinnacle of power, and his life fell apart anyway. And here’s the incredible part: he’s glad it happened! He praises God for having done it.
Do you know why? Because he says, “There was a spiritual cancer in me. There was something in me that was so bad, it was so dangerous, it had poisoned my soul so deeply that even as drastic as the treatment was, it was worth it to get it out of my soul.” What was it? Pride. Spiritual pride.
Could it be that we need to know the same lesson he learned? This text teaches us four things: it tells us about 1) the sleep of pride, 2) the heart of pride, 3) the outcome of pride, and 4) the healing of pride.

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Jeremiah is speaking at a time when his society was literally falling apart—politically, psychologically, socially and culturally. Everybody was asking, “What’s wrong?” And the answer of God through Jeremiah, was, “It’s not the economy. It’s sin.”</p>
<p>The Bible shows us that sin is a dislocation of the soul. The soul should be centered on God, and all of our problems come from our unwillingness to center on him because we don’t want to lose control. So what happens? What are the effects of centering on something else?</p>
<p>Jeremiah gives a metaphor of us falling in love with other gods, meaning these other things we center our lives on. And he shows that there are two major consequences: 1) our lover gods will always enslave us, and 2) our lover gods will always leave us empty.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 29, 1995. Series: The Seven Deadly Sins. Scripture: Jeremiah 2:19-32.</p>

<p>And God came through and said, “Let me tell you what’s wrong.” In Jeremiah 2, we have the first sermon by the prophet Jeremiah to the people of Israel. It’s a sermon to show them why their lives are falling apart, why their culture is falling apart, why their psyches are falling apart, why their families are falling apart. And it’s a sermon on sin.</p>
<p>There are three things that we learn from this passage about the nature of sin: 1) sin is denial, 2) sin is a disposition, and 3) there is a solution.</p>

<p>But the Bible says you can find God. Not just search for God, but find God. And the famous passage about the burning bush, where Moses finds God, is very important—it gives you all of the basic principles for truly finding God. And until the same three things that happened to Moses happen to you, you can’t find God.</p>
<p>Looking at this passage, we can see three stages: 1) the burning bush is a disrupting event, 2) when Moses gets closer he sees it’s an unmanageable power, and 3) in the midst of the burning bush, there’s an angel.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 4, 1998. Series: When All You’ve Ever Wanted Isn’t Enough. Scripture: Exodus 3:1-14.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>The Ecclesiastes writer says, “I have sought to construct meaning in life.” He takes the view of a practical secularist—that we don’t know for sure if there’s a God, and that this life is all there is. And then he asks, “If this life is all there is, does that make life meaningless?”</p>
<p>He tells us in Ecclesiastes that he tried to construct meaning by being a cause-based person who fought injustice. He tried to construct meaning by seeking pleasure and beauty. And next, he tries a work-based life, making career and achievement the organizing principle of life.</p>
<p>In exploring a work-based life, he finds three things: 1) a life of work is not worth it, 2) why it’s not worth it, 3) what is worth it.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>When you go on a spiritual search, there are problems people always run into. One of them is the problem of pain. But there’s also the problem of pleasure.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ve ever really talked to anybody who said, “I have trouble believing in God because of pleasure. Why is there pleasure in the world?” But my thesis, and the Ecclesiastes writer’s thesis, is that it should bother you, because pleasure is a huge problem. </p>
<p>The Ecclesiastes writer teaches us three things about pleasure: 1) what pleasure promises, 2) why it fails, and 3) how it points beyond.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 20, 1998. Series: When All You’ve Ever Wanted Isn’t Enough. Scripture: Ecclesiastes 2:1–11, 3:10–14.</p>

<p>I don’t think I’ve ever really talked to anybody who said, “I have trouble believing in God because of pleasure. Why is there pleasure in the world?” But my thesis, and the Ecclesiastes writer’s thesis, is that it should bother you, because pleasure is a huge problem. </p>

<p>The writer of Ecclesiastes asks, “If this life is all here is, what meaning is there in life?” To explore that, he looks at several questions we all have to answer in some way. The first of these is how we deal with the injustice and suffering we see in the world. How do you deal with injustice?</p>
<p>The Ecclesiastes writer 1) refuses to let you avoid the question of injustice, and 2) gives us clues to two answers for how to deal with injustice.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 13, 1998. Series: When All You’ve Ever Wanted Isn’t Enough. Scripture: Ecclesiastes 9:2–16.</p>

But usually, as we get older, we begin to wonder whether there’s any rhyme or reason to life. Scientifically, they now say life is chaotic, that there is nothing but disorder. That’s both the practical and the intellectual perception.</p>
<p>But Christianity has the most wonderful, the most sophisticated, and the most decisive answer to that perception: Jesus is King. When we see our lives and history looking chaotic, the Bible comes and says to us, “Calm down. There’s an explanation.”</p>
<p>Let me show you how the two aspects of the kingship of Christ make up this most wonderful answer: 1) Jesus Christ has a kingdom coming, and 2) Jesus is King right now of history.</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[By saying Jesus is a prophet, we mean he is a revealer. He communicates truth. He’s the revealer of who God is and what his will is. As a prophet, Jesus comes and speaks to you and to me for God.
Even though Jesus is far more than a prophet, he is a prophet. And the fact that Jesus is a prophet shows us that we have a God who speaks to us.

<p>In that one word, Immanuel, you have the most offensive and the most comforting, the most repulsive and the most attractive message the world has ever heard. It means “God with us.”</p>
<p>Let’s see how this message 1) is the most repulsive because it says Jesus Christ is God, and 2) is the most attractive because it says Jesus Christ is God with us.</p>

<p>Psalm 2 is one of the messianic psalms. In verse 2, it says, “The kings of the earth take their stand […] against the Lord and against his Anointed One.” Do you know what the word Anointed One is in Hebrew? It means Messiah.</p>
<p>This psalm is talking about the greater King. And it actually tells us three things: 1) we have a true King, 2) human beings hate the King, and 3) we need the King.</p>

<p>Moses starts saying, “I’m offering you this personal relationship with God.” He’s saying, “It’s not too difficult. It’s near you. You don’t have to go up to heaven. You don’t have to go over the sea.” And actually, people miss this personal relationship with God because it’s so simple; the simplicity is its difficulty.</p>
<p>We’re going to see here, when it comes to this personal, covenant relationship with God, 1) its deceptive ordinariness, 2) its threatening graciousness, and yet 3) its unimaginable promise.</p>

Moses starts saying, “I’m offering you this personal relationship with God.” He’s saying, “It’s not too difficult. It’s near you. You don’t have to go up to heaven. You don’t have to go over the sea.” And actually, people miss this personal relationship with God because it’s so simple; the simplicity is its difficulty.
We’re going to see here, when it comes to this personal, covenant relationship with God, 1) its deceptive ordinariness, 2) its threatening graciousness, and yet 3) its unimaginable promise.
This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 23, 2007. Series: The New Heart God Gives. Scripture: Deuteronomy 30:11-20.

<p>Here, at the very end of the end of his sermons, at the very end of the book of Deuteronomy, Moses gets to the most crucial things he could possibly tell anyone. Here he gives us the solution to what could be called the ultimate human problem. </p>
<p>So let’s ask 1) What’s that problem? 2) What’s the solution? 3) How do you know if you have it? and 4) If you don’t, how can you receive it?</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>If we look at Jesus Christ, at the case for Jesus being who he said he is, there are five things to see.</p>
<p>First, there was a man who claimed to be God. Second, he apparently did miracles. Third, he got the people closest to him to believe he was God. Fourth, after he was dead, many people saw him risen to life again. And fifth, those people were so transformed by the experience of meeting that risen Savior that they spread the word everywhere.</p>

<p>There’s great consensus that 1 Corinthians was written just 20 years after the death of Jesus Christ.

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the best ways of having a discussion about faith is to not simply talk about what you believe, but also how you came to believe it. Not just the content, but the process or the journey you went on. It’s often very helpful, because everybody is on a journey. </p>
<p>We’re looking now at a famous passage: Moses and the burning bush. Moses already believes in God, but until this, he’s never encountered him. This is Moses’ conversion experience: he actually meets God. </p>
<p>Four things bring Moses to this moment, and they’re the same four things the Bible says usually have to happen if you’re going to meet God. What are they? They are 1) a disrupting sight, 2) an expanding concept, 3) a personal problem, and 4) a surprising grace.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 3, 2013. Series: A Public Faith. Scripture: Exodus 3:1-14.</p>

And in a pluralistic society, we need to find ways of sharing our beliefs and being honest about who we are in a way that’s respectful and promotes peace.</p>
<p>One of the ways we can make for a more civil conversation is to ask a more fundamental question: Where do you get your moral convictions? How do you determine what is right and wrong? </p>
<p>There’s almost no place I know that has a more interesting answer to this question than Romans 2. It tells us three things: 1) no one can succeed in being a relativist, 2) no one can really succeed in being a moralist, and therefore, 3) this is our only hope.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 27, 2013. Series: A Public Faith. Scripture: Romans 2:12-29.</p>

<p>So how do you talk about God and God’s existence? One way to talk about this with more reflection is not to ask, “Does God exist?” but to ask, “How do you know whether God exists?”</p>
<p>I don’t think there’s any more brilliant answer to the question, “How can we know whether God exists?” than in Romans 1. Paul actually gives four answers, all at once. He says, 1) we can know God, 2) we do know God, 3) we don’t know God, and 4) we can truly know God.</p>

We don’t get much help here from either religious people or secular people. Religious people tend to see doubt as a bad thing. And secular people tend to think perennial doubt is the only sophisticated position. </p>
<p>However, what the Bible says about doubt is unique, nuanced, and multidimensional. The Bible sees doubt as something that’s not all good and not all bad. Only when you begin to see it in a nuanced way can it be something through which we make progress. </p>
<p>Let’s look at doubt in this famous psalm of Asaph: 1) what is it? 2) what causes it? and 3) what transforms it?</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 13, 2013. Series: A Public Faith. Scripture: Psalm 73:1-3, 12-26.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Ecclesiastes is one of the most confusing books in the world. It depicts a very disillusioned man. And you may be saying, “Is the Bible really saying all human life is pointless?” </p>
<p>To understand what’s going on here, we need to keep two things in mind. The author of Ecclesiastes is called qoheleth, which basically means professor. And he’s doing a thought experiment. So Ecclesiastes is a set of thought experiments in which the professor is saying, “Let’s imagine living like this. Does that work?”</p>
<p>If we want to understand what Ecclesiastes is after, we need to look at its thought experiments. So let’s look at it this way: 1) there’s a major thought experiment, 2) with a lesson, and 3) there’s a small thought experiment, and then 4) an arrow or a pointer.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 6, 2013. Series: A Public Faith. Scripture: Ecclesiastes 2:9-26.</p>

If we want to understand what Ecclesiastes is after, we need to look at its thought experiments. So let’s look at it this way: 1) there’s a major thought experiment, 2) with a lesson, and 3) there’s a small thought experiment, and then 4) an arrow or a pointer.
This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 6, 2013. Series: A Public Faith. Scripture: Ecclesiastes 2:9-26.

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>We live in a pluralistic society, so we must ask this question: how can people be true to themselves and still get along? No matter who you are, if you care about the social fabric, that’s a huge question to answer. </p>
<p>My goal is to show Christians how they can be part of the solution. We’re going to look at the subject of public faith. In John 4, we see that immediately after speaking to the Samaritan woman at the well, Jesus talks to his disciples and gets really metaphorical. He talks about spiritual sowing and reaping. What’s he trying to get across? </p>
<p>If we delve into it, we see that Jesus gives us 1) a call to spiritual sowing of seed, 2) the method of doing it, and then 3) the power, or the inner motivation, for doing it.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 29, 2013. Series: A Public Faith. Scripture: John 4:27-42.</p>

<p>Here is the case in three stages: 1) if you look at what the gospels claim, you’ll see they’re not written as legends or fiction; they’re either historical accounts or a deliberate hoax, 2) we now know now that all of the gospels were written within the lifetime of eyewitnesses, and 3) the same rules of historiography that are used on other documents of antiquity show the gospels to be trustworthy.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>The trouble with the Sermon on the Mount is it’s so familiar that almost nobody listens to it, almost nobody knows what it’s saying. How do we know that?</p>
<p>At the very end of the sermon, it says the crowds were amazed at Jesus’s teaching. And that word, “amazed,” in Greek meant thunderstruck, shocked, astounded. That’s the prevailing way people responded. Have you been thunderstruck? Are you shocked by it? If you’re not astounded, you haven’t listened to it. </p>
<p>So let’s listen to it. There are basically three great things Jesus says that are utterly astounding: 1) that there are two ways, two options spiritually, 2) that at the end of those two ways, there’s a judge, and 3) that at the end of that judgment, there’s a sentence.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on May 23, 1999. Series: The Mount; Life in the Kingdom. Scripture: Matthew 7:15-29.</p>

<p>The Sermon on the Mount is really a description of a new kind of community. What does Jesus teach us about this radical new community that is formed by his gospel message? When it comes into your life, how does it create this new community between those who believe in Jesus? </p>
<p>Jesus teaches us four things: 1) the necessity of this new community, 2) the intensity of this new community, 3) the symmetry of this new community, and 4) the causality of this new community.</p>

                                    <description><![CDATA[<p>When people say, “I’ve tried prayer, and it didn’t work,” what Jesus is saying is, “You used prayer, not the way I designed it, but with a false model of spirituality.”</p>
<p>For Jesus, the importance of prayer is revealed in a little unobtrusive word at the beginning of this passage in the Sermon on the Mount: the little word “and.” Right before Jesus talks about prayer, he talks about our engagement with the poor and the needs of the world. Then he says, “And when you pray …” Because in Jesus’ understanding, it’s the people who are characterized by the most radical interiority who have the most courageous, visionary engagement with the needs of the world. And before Jesus gives us a model of prayer, the famous Lord’s Prayer, he tells us two other models of prayer that we should avoid. </p>
<p>Let’s look at 1) the two false models, 2) the true model, and 3) a few practical ideas on how to go about it.</p>
<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on May 9, 1999. Series: The Mount; Life in the Kingdom. Scripture: Matthew 6:5-13.</p>
